I'm begining a project that should search Paratext project folders using sil-machine as far as possible to parse the data.

The aim of this is to search through the SFM files in projects and record data in csv and xslx format about each project.

The kinds of data that this should collect are: A list of all the SFM markers used in each project by book, along with a count (probably making use of Counter) .

A list of the punctuation used in each project, by book, along with counts of the occurences.

A list of 5 shortest words and 5 longest words. The exact number should be configurable by the user at runtime.

The first task, or at least a very important one will be to design what the output should look like. Spreadsheets are simple, but maybe there would be too much data. (There are tens of hundreds of projects and some have 66 books and a few have more.)

Perhaps we need a detailled set of spreadsheets for each project, and then a summary sheet that combines some key information about each (totals perhaps rather than book by book)

What are the main things to clarify at the start?


Gemini
It sounds like you're embarking on a very interesting and potentially complex project! Analyzing a large number of Paratext projects can yield a wealth of information. You're right to think carefully about the output design from the outset, especially given the potential volume of data. Clear output is key to making the collected data usable and insightful.

Here are the main things I'd suggest clarifying at the start to guide your output design:

1. Define the Purpose and Audience:

What are the primary goals? What specific questions are you (or others) trying to answer with this data? For example:
Are you looking for consistency in SFM marker usage across projects or within a single project?
Is it for linguistic analysis (e.g., common punctuation patterns, word length distributions)?
Is it for project management (e.g., assessing the "completeness" or complexity of projects)?
Are you trying to identify outliers or unusual patterns?
Who will be using these reports?
Are they technical users who might process the data further (e.g., with scripts)?
Are they project managers or linguists who prefer human-readable summaries and dashboards?
The audience's technical skills and needs will heavily influence the choice between CSV, XLSX, and the level of detail in summaries.
2. Clarify Data Granularity and Aggregation:

SFM Markers & Punctuation:
You mentioned "by book." Is a book-by-book breakdown essential in the primary output for all projects, or would project-level totals (e.g., total unique markers, total instances of each marker) be more useful in a summary, with book-level details available in a separate, more detailed report per project?
What kinds of totals are most valuable? (e.g., count of unique markers per project, total instances of all markers, frequency of specific critical markers).
Shortest/Longest Words:
You've specified this is per project. This seems sensible. Confirm if there's any scenario where book-level shortest/longest words would be needed (this could significantly increase data volume).
3. Sketch out the Output Structure (and get feedback):

Your idea of a summary sheet and detailed spreadsheets is a good starting point. Consider this potential structure:

A. Master Summary Report (e.g., project_analysis_summary.xlsx and/or project_analysis_summary.csv):

One row per Paratext project.
Key Columns:
ProjectName
ProjectFolderPath (relative or absolute)
ProcessingStatus (e.g., "Success," "Error: No SFM files found," "Error: Parsing issue")
ErrorMessage (if status is not "Success")
TotalBooksProcessed
TotalUniqueSFMMarkers (project-wide count)
TotalSFMMarkerInstances (project-wide sum of all marker counts)
TopNCommonSFMMarkers (e.g., \p (1050), \v (800), \c (66) ... - N could be configurable)
TotalUniquePunctuationChars (project-wide count)
TotalPunctuationInstances (project-wide sum of all punctuation counts)
TopNCommonPunctuation (e.g., . (5000), , (4500), ? (300) ...)
[Configurable_N]_ShortestWords (e.g., "a, is, of, to, an")
[Configurable_N]_LongestWords (e.g., "establishmentarianism, ...")
LinkToDetailedReport (e.g., a path to the project's specific detailed file/folder)
B. Detailed Per-Project Reports (e.g., in a detailed_reports/{ProjectName}/ subfolder):

Option 1: Single XLSX file per project (e.g., {ProjectName}_details.xlsx)
Sheet 1: SFM_Markers_By_Book
Columns: BookID (e.g., GEN, EXO - using your BOOK_ORDER for sorting), SFMMarker, Count
Sheet 2: Punctuation_By_Book
Columns: BookID, PunctuationCharacter, Count
Sheet 3: Project_Metadata (optional)
Could include: Date Analyzed, specific settings used for the analysis, total verse/chapter counts if available from sil-machine.
Option 2: Multiple CSV files per project in its folder
{ProjectName}_sfm_markers_by_book.csv
{ProjectName}_punctuation_by_book.csv
{ProjectName}_metadata.json (or .txt)
CSVs are generally better if the data needs to be consumed by other programs or if individual Excel files become too unwieldy.
4. Define Key Terms and Scope:

What constitutes a "word"? This is crucial for the shortest/longest word analysis.
How will you handle case sensitivity (e.g., "Word" vs "word")?
How will numbers, hyphens (e.g., "God-fearing"), and apostrophes (e.g., "don't") be treated?
Should SFM markers themselves be excluded from word tokenization? (Almost certainly yes).
sil-machine might have opinions or tools for tokenization; align with those if possible.
What constitutes "punctuation"?
Will you use a standard set (like Python's string.punctuation)?
Should the list of tracked punctuation characters be configurable?
SFM Marker Scope:
Are you interested in all SFM markers found, or a specific subset (e.g., only textual content markers, excluding formatting or note markers)?
5. Consider Scalability and Usability:

"Tens of hundreds of projects": If it's closer to 200-300, individual detailed XLSX files are probably fine. If it's 1000+, managing that many files could be cumbersome. The summary file becomes even more critical.
How frequently will these reports be generated? If it's a one-time analysis, file management is less of an issue than if it's a recurring task.
For very large datasets, CSVs are often more performant to generate and process than XLSX files.
6. Plan for Configuration:

You've already identified the number of shortest/longest words as configurable.
What else might need to be configurable?
Input directory for projects (you have PROJECTS_FOLDER from .env).
Output directory for reports.
List of punctuation characters to track.
Perhaps a list of specific SFM markers to focus on or exclude.
7. Error Handling and Reporting in Output:

How should projects that cannot be processed (e.g., missing settings files, no SFM data, parsing errors from sil-machine) be represented in the summary report? A clear status column is important.
How should empty books or books with no relevant data be handled in the detailed book-by-book reports (e.g., omit them, or list them with zero counts)?
By thinking through these questions, you'll be in a much better position to design an output format that is not only comprehensive but also genuinely useful for the intended audience and purpose. It's often helpful to create a small, mock-up example of your proposed Excel/CSV files with dummy data to visualize how it would look and feel.

Good luck with your project! It sounds like a valuable tool.

David Baines
Define the Purpose and Audience:
What are the primary goals? What specific questions are you (or others) trying to answer with this data? For example: I'm looking for the common punctuation patterns. Initially those used for quotations are of interest. I'm looking for the most complex projects in terms of it's SFM structure and use of custom.sty. These projects will make good test subjects for other code. I'm looking for a note of the main script used and whether it is left to right or right to left. We're not looking for detailed linguistic info beyond longest and shortest words. Looking for good test subjects is the main initial aim. So finding what is usual and what are outliers are both useful.

Who will be using these reports? The users will be technical users who might process the data further with scripts.

Clarify Data Granularity and Aggregation:
SFM Markers & Punctuation: I think that we would need to analyse or search all the books to get the project-level summaries any way. So that data might as well be stored in a machine-readable way so that the script can read in the process-so-far if it is interrupted. Project level totals may be used first to identify projects of interest, then it will be necessary to drill down to the book level to find the books of interest in that project. I guess that a book-by-book breakdown is valuable.

What kinds of totals are most valuable? Total instances of all markers would be valuable. Perhaps also simple even though it requires more processing and storage. Since I don't know what I will find, it's difficult to specify up front which markers are of interest. The same is true for punctuation.

Shortest/Longest Words: I don't think that book-level shortest/longest words would be needed - but we could use a way to find examples of them. 3. A Master Summary report is ideal and the columns are a very good start. B Let's use option 1 a single XLSX files so that different data on different sheets can be used. 4. We can ignore case for words and use the Unidode charater information as to whether a charater is word-forming or not. Then a word is delimited by non-wordforming characters. Treat all hyphens according to whether Unicode considers them to be word-forming or not. Yes all SFM markers should be considered separate - sil-machine should do this for the script anyway so that the script doesn't have to do that itself. We won't use python's string.punctuation, unless it is an abstract or proxy for the Unicode information for the character. I want to use the Unicode information for the character because of the large number of scripts expected and I guess that the Unicode information will be more complete than that in some python libraries. I'm interested in ALL SFM markers. The reports will be generated once per project. Ideally if the code can look for the XLSX files first in the output folder, it wont need to process them again. (Unless a --force flag is passed.) Let's define the OUTPUT_FOLDER in the .env file too and keep all the project level and summary XLSX files there. the project level ones can have the project name. Let's include a hard-coded list of SFM markers to exclude. It can be empty initially and I can complete it as I find necessary. If all the project level files contain all the SFM marker counts then this hard coded list can apply only to the summary sheets. In that way recalculation of each project's data isn't necessary.

A clear status column in the main summary is a great idea.

This is excellent! Your detailed responses provide a much clearer picture of the project's aims and how the output should be structured. This level of clarity upfront is invaluable.

Let's go through your points and confirm the refined understanding:

1. Purpose and Audience:

Primary Goals Confirmed:
Identify common punctuation patterns, with an initial focus on quotation marks.
Pinpoint "complex" projects (SFM structure, custom.sty usage) to serve as robust test subjects for other development work. This means identifying both "typical" and "outlier" projects.
Record the main script used (e.g., Latin, Devanagari) and its writing direction (LTR/RTL).
Linguistic analysis is limited to shortest/longest words.
Audience Confirmed: Technical users who will likely use scripts to process the generated reports further. This reinforces the need for well-structured, machine-readable output (like CSVs or clearly defined XLSX sheets).
2. Data Granularity and Aggregation:

SFM Markers & Punctuation:
Strategy: Yes, analyzing all books within a project to generate project-level summaries is the way to go. Storing the detailed book-by-book data first is a great idea. This raw data can then be aggregated for the project summary.
Resumability: Storing this intermediate book-level data (perhaps as temporary files like per-book CSVs or JSON during processing for a given project) before creating the final project XLSX is a smart approach. If the script is interrupted, it could potentially pick up from these intermediate files for that specific project.
Drill-Down: The approach of using project-level totals to identify interesting projects, and then having the book-level details available for deeper dives, is sound.
Valuable Totals:
Collecting total instances of all SFM markers and all punctuation characters, along with unique counts, is a good "collect everything first" strategy, especially when you're in an exploratory phase. You can always filter or aggregate later.
Shortest/Longest Words:
Project-level analysis is sufficient.
Crucially, you want to record the actual words, not just their lengths, and potentially have a way to find examples of their usage (though context might be a v2 feature if too complex initially).
3. Output Structure:

A. Master Summary Report: This is definitely the way to go. A single XLSX file (e.g., project_analysis_summary.xlsx) and potentially an accompanying CSV version (project_analysis_summary.csv) for easier programmatic access would be ideal for your technical audience. The columns you previously outlined, with additions based on your new requirements (see below), will form a strong basis.
B. Detailed Per-Project Reports: Using a single XLSX file per project (e.g., {OUTPUT_FOLDER}/{ProjectName}_details.xlsx) with different data types on separate sheets is a good choice for keeping related information together.
4. Key Terms, Scope, and Operational Details:

"Word" Definition:
Case-insensitivity: Good.
Delimiters: Using Unicode character properties to determine "word-forming" vs. "non-word-forming" characters is the most robust approach for handling diverse scripts. Python's unicodedata module will be your friend here (e.g., checking unicodedata.category(char)).
Hyphens: Treating them based on their Unicode properties (e.g., some hyphens are connectors, others are dashes) is correct.
SFM Markers: Agreed, these should be excluded from word tokenization; sil-machine should handle the separation of text content from markers.
"Punctuation" Definition:
Again, relying on Unicode character properties (e.g., categories starting with 'P' like Po, Ps, Pe, Pc, Pd, Pf, Pi) is the right internationalized approach, rather than a fixed list like string.punctuation.
SFM Marker Scope: Analyzing all SFM markers found in the files is a good default.
Report Generation & Caching:
Generating reports once per project is sensible.
Checking for existing XLSX files in the OUTPUT_FOLDER and skipping reprocessing unless a --force flag is used is an excellent efficiency measure.
Defining OUTPUT_FOLDER in your .env file is good practice.
SFM Exclusion List:
The idea of a hard-coded (but initially empty) list of SFM markers to exclude from the summary sheets only is very practical. This allows the detailed per-project files to remain a complete record, while the summary can be tailored without reprocessing everything.
Addressing New Requirements & Suggestions:

custom.sty Analysis:
Detection: Checking for the presence of PROJECT_PATH/custom.sty.
Complexity Indication (for summary):
HasCustomSty (boolean) in the summary.
CustomStyMarkerDefinitionCount: If feasible, parse custom.sty (e.g., with regex for \Marker \custommarker lines) to count defined custom markers. This can be tricky due to TeX syntax variations.
CustomStyMarkerUsageCount: This would require first identifying the custom markers (from step 2 or a manually supplied list if parsing custom.sty is too complex initially) and then counting their occurrences in the SFM files.
The detailed project report could list the identified custom markers.
Script and Direction (LTR/RTL):
Source: This information is often in Paratext project settings files.
Settings.xml: Look for elements like <LanguageName>, <LanguageCode>, font information, or ScriptureText attributes like direction="rtl". This would require XML parsing.
sil-machine: The ParatextTextCorpus might load and expose some of this project metadata. It's worth investigating what corpus.project_settings (or similar) might offer after loading a project.
Output: Add MainScript and ScriptDirection columns to the master summary and the project metadata sheet.
Quotation Punctuation Analysis:
Once you have the full punctuation list with counts (and ideally Unicode categories like Ps for open-punctuation, Pe for close-punctuation, Pi/Pf for initial/final quotes), you can perform a secondary analysis.
You could look for common pairs (e.g., high counts of a specific Ps character associated with a specific Pe character) or predefined sets of quotation marks across different languages. This might be a separate script that consumes the primary output or a dedicated section in your analysis.
Unicode Character Information:
As discussed, Python's unicodedata module will be key:
unicodedata.category(char): To classify characters (e.g., "Lu" for Letter Upper, "Po" for Punctuation Other, "Zs" for Space Separator).
unicodedata.name(char): Can be useful for debugging or understanding unusual characters.
unicodedata.bidirectional(char): Might help with LTR/RTL analysis if direct settings are unavailable, though script-level settings are more reliable.
Refined Master Summary Columns (Example):

ProjectName
ProjectFolderPath
ProcessingStatus (e.g., "Success", "Error: No SFM", "Error: Parsing")
ErrorMessage (if applicable)
DateAnalyzed (timestamp of analysis)
TotalBooksProcessed
MainScript (e.g., "Latin", "Devanagari", "Arabic")
ScriptDirection ("LTR", "RTL", "Unknown")
HasCustomSty (True/False)
CustomStyDefinedMarkerCount (integer, or N/A)
CustomStyUsedMarkerCount (integer, or N/A)
TotalUniqueSFMMarkers_Summary (after summary exclusions)
TotalSFMMarkerInstances_Summary (after summary exclusions)
TopNCommonSFMMarkers_Summary (e.g., \p (1050), \v (800))
TotalUniquePunctuationChars
TotalPunctuationInstances
TopNCommonPunctuation (e.g., . (5000), , (4500))
[N]_ShortestWords (comma-separated list of words)
[N]_LongestWords (comma-separated list of words)
PathToDetailedReport (relative path to the project's XLSX)
Refined Detailed Per-Project XLSX Sheets:

SFM_Markers_By_Book: BookID, SFMMarker, Count (all markers, no exclusions)
Punctuation_By_Book: BookID, PunctuationCharacter, UnicodeName, UnicodeCategory, Count
Word_Extremes: Type ("Shortest" / "Longest"), Word, Length (examples of usage context can be a stretch goal)
Project_Metadata: ProjectName, DateAnalyzed, AnalysisSettingsUsed, MainScript, ScriptDirection, PathToCustomSty (if exists), List_of_SFM_files_processed, sil_machine_version (good for reproducibility).
This refined plan looks very solid. The focus on Unicode properties for text processing and the clear distinction between detailed data and summarized data will be very beneficial. The new elements like custom.sty and script direction analysis will significantly add to the value for identifying suitable test projects.

No direct changes to your existing find_projects.py are immediately suggested by this feedback, as it's focused on project discovery. The next steps would involve building out the analysis logic that consumes the projects found by this script.

Yes this looks great and here are a few modifications or clarifications.

Data Granularity and Aggregation: Resumability: The final project-level XLSX files will be sufficient granularity for resuming. That will avoid any temporary files and simplify the process and logic.

Output Structure: Yes, Agree will all these points.

Key Terms, Scope, and Operational Details: Yes, Agree will all these points.

custom.sty Analysis: Detection: Checking for the presence of PROJECT_PATH/custom.sty. Complexity Indication (for summary): HasCustomSty (boolean) in the summary.

Let's leave any more detail regarding custom.sty to a later version if it is necessary. If it is necessary the parsing should be handled by sil-machine.

Script and Direction (LTR/RTL): Source: This information is often in Paratext project settings files. Some Settings.xml files contain a line &lt;LeftToRight&gt;T&lt;/LeftToRight&gt; T meaning True and F meaning False. SIL-Machine should be able to parse Settings files. That might require some investigation to see how. Could you workl on the next steps would involve building out the analysis logic that consumes the projects found by this script.


Gemini
Okay, this is a great set of clarifications! It helps solidify the plan.

Resumability: Understood. The primary goal for resumability is to avoid re-generating an individual project's detailed XLSX file if it already exists (unless --force is used). The summary report will be generated based on the projects processed or loaded in that run.
custom.sty Analysis: Perfect. A simple boolean HasCustomSty in the summary based on file presence is the initial step. Deeper analysis is deferred.
Script and Direction (LTR/RTL): Your note about <LeftToRight>T</LeftToRight> (True for LTR, False for RTL) is key. sil-machine (specifically ParatextProjectSettings populated by ParatextProjectSettingsParser from sil.machine.corpora) should indeed be able to provide this. The is_right_to_left attribute on the settings object will be what we need.
Let's outline the core analysis logic. I'll provide a Python script skeleton that sets up the main processing loop, data structures, and placeholders for where sil-machine will be heavily used. This script will:

Read project folders.
For each project:
Perform the analysis (SFM markers, punctuation, word extremes, custom.sty check, LTR/RTL).
Generate a detailed XLSX report for that project (if new or --force is specified).
Generate a master summary XLSX and CSV report.
This will be a fairly comprehensive starting point. You'll then integrate the actual sil-machine calls and refine the token-level processing.

Here's a Python script (project_analyzer.py) that lays out this structure:

Key areas for your next steps with sil-machine:

Installation: Ensure sil-machine and its dependencies are correctly installed in your Python environment.
ParatextTextCorpus Usage:
Replace the mock ParatextTextCorpus with the real one from sil.machine.corpora.
The iteration for row in corpus: should yield TextRow objects.
Access row.ref.book for the book ID.
Access row.segment for the list of UsfmToken objects.
UsfmToken and UsfmTokenType:
Import UsfmTokenType from sil.machine.usfm.
The logic for identifying SFM markers needs to be robust. UsfmToken objects have a type (e.g., UsfmTokenType.CHAPTER, UsfmTokenType.VERSE, UsfmTokenType.PARAGRAPH, UsfmTokenType.CHARACTER, UsfmTokenType.NOTE) and a text attribute (which for marker types is usually the marker itself, like "c", "v", "p", "wj").
You'll need to decide precisely which UsfmTokenTypes and their corresponding text values constitute the "SFM markers" you want to count. The current logic if token.type not in [UsfmTokenType.TEXT, UsfmTokenType.END]: is a starting point and might need refinement. For example, UsfmTokenType.ID (for \id) or specific UsfmTokenType.CHARACTER markers.
Project Settings: Verify that corpus.project_settings.is_right_to_left and corpus.project_settings.script (or .language_name) provide the correct LTR/RTL and script information.
Error Handling: sil-machine might raise specific exceptions during project loading or parsing. You may want to add more specific try-except blocks.
Word Tokenization: The is_word_char function is a good Unicode-based start. sil-machine itself has tokenizers (e.g., LatinWordTokenizer, or you might use a more generic one or stick to your character-category-based approach if it suits the diversity of scripts). Your current approach is likely fine for initial analysis.
This script provides a solid foundation. The main work will be in the analyze_project_data function, ensuring the interaction with sil-machine's objects correctly extracts the markers, text, and metadata you need. Good luck!

This is an incredible starting point! I haven't seen programming done this way - where the skeleton of the code is built first with place holder functions for the details. It looks like a very effective strategy.

I've added import statements for many of the sil-machine functions. These are all installing correctly. I guess we can remove the mock classes and start development and testing with the real ones.

For the "punctuation by book" sheet in the detailled spreadsheet, let's list the SFM markers in the first column and the Book IDs in the first row with the appropriate counts in the intersection cell.


Gemini
This is an excellent way to approach software development, building the skeleton and then fleshing out the details! It helps ensure the overall structure is sound before diving too deep into specifics. I'm glad the sil-machine imports are working for you.

Let's proceed with your requests:

Remove the mock classes: Since sil-machine is now integrated, we can remove the placeholder mock objects.
Revise the "Punctuation_By_Book" sheet: We'll change this sheet to display SFM markers as rows, Book IDs as columns, and the cells will contain the total count of punctuation instances found within the context of that SFM marker for that specific book.
Here are the proposed changes:

I. Removing Mock Classes and Test Exit

The mock classes and the sys.exit(0) for testing imports will be removed. The script will rely on the actual sil-machine components.

II. Modifying Punctuation Analysis and Reporting

Data Collection (analyze_project_data):

We will continue to collect punctuation character by character per book in project_results["PunctuationByBook"] as this is used for the summary report and provides a general overview.
A new data structure, project_results["PunctuationPivotCounts"] (e.g., a defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))), will be introduced. This will store {sfm_marker: {book_id: total_punctuation_count}}.
As the script processes tokens, we'll keep track of the last_sfm_marker_for_context. When text tokens are encountered, any punctuation within them will be counted, and this total will be added to PunctuationPivotCounts[last_sfm_marker_for_context][current_book_id].
Report Generation (generate_detailed_project_report):

The sheet currently named "Punctuation_By_Book" will be generated using the data from project_results["PunctuationPivotCounts"].
We'll use pandas to create a DataFrame from this data, then format it so SFM markers are the index (rows) and Book IDs (sorted according to BOOK_ORDER) are the columns. The cell values will be the aggregated punctuation counts.
DataFrame Creation for Empty Lists:

The lines like pd.DataFrame(sfm_data_list if sfm_data_list else columns==["BookID", "SFMMarker", "Count"]) had a typo (columns==). This will be corrected to columns=.
Let's look at the code modifications.

Summary of Changes:

Mock Class Removal: All mock class definitions (MockUsfmToken, MockTextRow, MockParatextProjectSettings, MockParatextTextCorpus) and the conditional UsfmTokenType mock definition have been removed.
Test sys.exit(0) Removed: The line sys.exit(0) after the import block has been removed.
Corpus Instantiation: The analyze_project_data function now directly instantiates ParatextTextCorpus(project_path) without the mock fallback.
New Punctuation Data Structure:
In analyze_project_data, project_results now initializes "PunctuationPivotCounts": defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int)).
Punctuation Collection for Pivot:
A last_sfm_marker_for_context variable is maintained.
When text is processed, the total number of punctuation characters in that text segment is counted.
This count is added to project_results["PunctuationPivotCounts"][last_sfm_marker_for_context][book_id].
The original project_results["PunctuationByBook"][book_id][char] += 1 is kept for the summary report.
Revised "Punctuation_By_Book" Sheet Generation:
In generate_detailed_project_report, this sheet is now generated from project_results["PunctuationPivotCounts"].
It creates a DataFrame where the index is the SFM marker, columns are Book IDs (ordered by BOOK_ORDER and only including books with relevant data), and cell values are the total punctuation counts.
The sheet is written with index=True and index_label="SFMMarker".
DataFrame Creation Fix: Corrected columns== to columns= when creating empty DataFrames.
These changes should give you the desired output format for the punctuation sheet while ensuring the rest of the analysis and summary reporting remains functional. You can now test this with your actual Paratext projects!

Ah - sorry I put in the wrong Sheet name - that really confuses things. I meant the SFM_Markers_By_Book sheet.

Though the punctuation by book might follow a similar format. Here's the sample from the current SFM_Markers_By_Book

plaintext: 7 lines selected
I'm suggesting we could do this instead:

plaintext: 4 lines selected
This would be more compact and avoid duplicating the SFM_Markers in different rows. Punctuation by Book could be rearranged in a similar way:

plaintext: 3 lines selected
Would become:

plaintext: 2 lines selected
Using the Unicode name would avoid any issues with special characters messing up the format. All the extra data can be found in references if necessary.

Okay, I understand the clarification! It's easy for sheet names and formats to get mixed up when discussing complex data.

You want to pivot both the "SFM_Markers_By_Book" sheet and the "Punctuation_By_Book" sheet for a more compact, wide-format view.

For SFM_Markers_By_Book:

Rows: SFM Markers (e.g., \c, \p, \v)
Columns: Book IDs (e.g., GEN, EXO)
Values: Counts of each SFM marker in that book.
For Punctuation_By_Book:

Rows: Unicode Name of the punctuation character (e.g., FULL STOP)
Columns: Book IDs (e.g., GEN, EXO)
Values: Counts of each punctuation type (by Unicode name) in that book.
This makes a lot of sense for readability and compactness.

Here's how we can adjust the code:

In analyze_project_data:

We'll keep collecting SFMMarkersByBook as {book_id: {marker: count}}.
We'll keep collecting PunctuationByBook as {book_id: {char: count}} (this is still useful for the summary report's "TopNCommonPunctuation").
We'll add a new structure, project_results["PunctuationByNameAndBook"] = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int)), to store {unicode_name: {book_id: count}}. This will be populated as we iterate through text.
In generate_detailed_project_report:

The "SFM_Markers_By_Book" sheet will be generated by transforming SFMMarkersByBook into the desired pivot table.
The "Punctuation_By_Book" sheet will be generated directly from PunctuationByNameAndBook and pivoted.
I'll also correct the columns== typo to columns= when creating empty DataFrames.

Key changes in this diff:

analyze_project_data:

A new dictionary project_results["PunctuationByNameAndBook"] is initialized.
When a punctuation character is found, its Unicode name is retrieved, and the count is updated in project_results["PunctuationByNameAndBook"][unicode_name][book_id].
The previous logic for PunctuationPivotCounts (related to SFM marker context for punctuation) has been removed as it's superseded by the new requirements.
generate_detailed_project_report:

Sheet SFM_Markers_By_Book:
The data from project_results["SFMMarkersByBook"] (which is {book_id: {marker: count}}) is transformed into sfm_pivot_ready_data ({marker: {book_id: count}}).
This is then converted to a Pandas DataFrame, with SFM markers as the index and Book IDs as columns.
Columns are ordered according to BOOK_ORDER, and the index (SFM markers) is sorted alphabetically.
Sheet Punctuation_By_Book:
The data from project_results["PunctuationByNameAndBook"] is directly used to create a Pandas DataFrame with Unicode names as the index and Book IDs as columns.
Columns are ordered, and the index (Unicode names) is sorted alphabetically.
Typo Fix: columns== changed to columns= for empty DataFrame creation in the "Word_Extremes" sheet.
This should now produce the Excel sheets in the pivoted format you've described.

I'm getting this error: Found 9 potential projects. Analyzing project: aai... Warning: Could not retrieve project_settings for aai via corpus. Error analyzing project aai: 'str' object has no attribute 'type' Traceback (most recent call last): File "F:\GitHub\davidbaines\project_analyser\project_analyser\project_analyser.py", line 269, in analyze_project_data if token.type not in [UsfmTokenType.TEXT, UsfmTokenType.END]: AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'type'


Gemini
The error AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'type' arises because the code was expecting UsfmToken objects when iterating through row.segment from a ParatextTextCorpus, but row.segment actually provides a sequence of string tokens. The ParatextTextCorpus is designed to yield processed text rows (often verses) rather than a raw stream of USFM structural tokens.

To correctly access UsfmToken objects and analyze the USFM structure (like markers and their types), we need to change the approach:

Identify all USFM files within the project.
For each file, read its content.
Use UsfmTokenizer (from sil.machine.corpora) to tokenize the raw USFM content of each file. This tokenizer will produce a stream of UsfmToken objects.
Iterate through these UsfmToken objects to perform the analysis.
The project settings (like LTR/RTL direction and script) can be obtained by parsing the project's Settings.xml file, for which FileParatextProjectSettingsParser can be used.

I'll provide a diff that refactors the analyze_project_data function to use this direct USFM tokenization method. I will also remove the mock sil-machine classes as they are no longer representative of the actual library's behavior in this context and the main imports seem to be working.

The line: from machine import STYLESHEETS_PATH Seems to cause an error. The path to the usfm.sty file, the standard stylesheet is machine.py/machine/corpora/usfm.sty.


Gemini
You're right to point out the issue with STYLESHEETS_PATH. That constant isn't directly available for import in the way it was used. The standard usfm.sty file is indeed co-located with the corpora module within the machine library.

We can construct the path to the default stylesheet more reliably.

Here's how to adjust the code:

Locate the machine.corpora module: We can use import machine.corpora and then machine.corpora.__file__ to get the path to the __init__.py file within that directory.
Construct the path to usfm.sty: From the directory of machine.corpora, we can then navigate to usfm.sty.
Let's apply this to your project_analyser.py script.

project_analyser.py

import pandas as pd

from pathlib import Path

                default_sil_stylesheet_path = Path(STYLESHEETS_PATH) / "usfm.sty"
                # Construct path to the default usfm.sty relative to the machine.corpora module
                default_sil_stylesheet_path = Path(machine.corpora.__file__).parent / "usfm.sty"
                 if default_sil_stylesheet_path.exists():
                     stylesheet = UsfmStylesheet(str(default_sil_stylesheet_path))
                 else:

Explanation of Changes:

Import machine.corpora:

Added import machine.corpora at the top. This import is primarily to help locate the directory of the sil-machine's corpora module.
Construct Default Stylesheet Path:

Removed the problematic from machine import STYLESHEETS_PATH.
Replaced Path(STYLESHEETS_PATH) / "usfm.sty" with:
python
default_sil_stylesheet_path = Path(machine.corpora.__file__).parent / "usfm.sty"
machine.corpora.__file__ gives the full path to the __init__.py file of the machine.corpora package (e.g., .../site-packages/machine/corpora/__init__.py).
.parent then gives the directory containing this file (e.g., .../site-packages/machine/corpora/).
We then append usfm.sty to get the full path to the default stylesheet.
This approach is more robust as it directly uses the location of the installed sil-machine library to find its bundled stylesheet, rather than relying on a potentially non-existent or differently named constant.

Now the error is: Warning: Error loading project settings for aai: 'ParatextProjectSettings' object has no attribute 'is_right_to_left'.


Gemini
It looks like the ParatextProjectSettings object returned by settings_parser.parse() doesn't always have the is_right_to_left or script attributes, especially if the Settings.xml file is missing or malformed.

We should handle this more gracefully by checking for the existence of these attributes before trying to access them. If they don't exist, we can fall back to default values for "ScriptDirection" and "MainScript" and set the ProcessingStatus to "Warning" with an appropriate message.

Also, the sys.exit(1) calls in the settings parsing block are a bit too aggressive. Instead of exiting the whole script, we should set an error status for the current project and allow the script to continue processing other projects.

Key changes:

Graceful Attribute Access:

Before accessing settings.is_right_to_left, settings.script, settings.language_name, and settings.stylesheet_filename, we now use hasattr() to check if the settings object actually possesses these attributes.
If an attribute is missing, a default value ("Unknown" or the default stylesheet name) is used, and the ProcessingStatus for the project is set to "Warning" with a descriptive message appended to ErrorMessage.
Removed sys.exit(1):

The sys.exit(1) calls within the settings parsing try-except block have been removed.
If settings_parser.parse() returns None (meaning settings couldn't be parsed at all), or if an exception occurs during settings access, the script now prints a warning, updates the project's ProcessingStatus and ErrorMessage, and continues. This allows the analysis to proceed to the stylesheet loading step (which will likely use the default stylesheet) and then to USFM file processing, rather than halting the entire script.
This should make the script more resilient to variations or issues in Settings.xml files across different Paratext projects.

If there is a usfm.sty file in the project folder it can be ignored for the purposes of this script. We just need to look for a file named "custom.sty" in the project folder. That's the file that will cause the "HasCustomSty" field to be marked as true.

As far as possible we should use the Machine library to do all the parsing. Which maybe what is happening.


Gemini
You're right, we can simplify the stylesheet handling for the UsfmTokenizer if the goal is just to identify the presence of custom.sty for the HasCustomSty flag, and then use the standard usfm.sty for the actual parsing. This aligns well with using the sil-machine library for its core parsing capabilities with a known, standard stylesheet.

Here's how we can modify the analyze_project_data function:

The check for custom.sty to set project_results["HasCustomSty"] will remain.
The logic for trying to load settings.stylesheet_filename or a project-specific usfm.sty for the UsfmTokenizer will be removed.
The UsfmTokenizer will always be initialized using the default usfm.sty bundled with the sil-machine library.
This simplifies the setup for the tokenizer while still correctly flagging projects that have a custom.sty.

Now it's necessary to discover why each project has the ErrorMessage: "Could not determine LTR/RTL from settings. Could not determine script/language from settings. " Also why "TotalBooksProcessed " is marked as 0 for each project. This might explain why no SFM markers or Punctuation is reported. However, it looks like books must be being parsed, since the longest and shortest words are being found.


Gemini
It seems like we're running into a couple of related issues here:

Settings Parsing: The script isn't successfully extracting LTR/RTL direction or script/language information from the Settings.xml files. This is why you're seeing "Could not determine LTR/RTL from settings. Could not determine script/language from settings."
Book ID Processing: The TotalBooksProcessed is 0, and consequently, no SFM markers or punctuation counts are being associated with specific books. This usually means that the \id markers (or UsfmTokenType.BOOK tokens) are not being correctly identified or that the current_book_id_for_file isn't being set as expected.
Word Processing Discrepancy: The fact that shortest/longest words are being found suggests that text content (UsfmTokenType.TEXT) is being processed, but perhaps outside the context of a recognized book ID.
Let's address these.

Issue 1: Settings Parsing (FileParatextProjectSettingsParser)

The FileParatextProjectSettingsParser from sil-machine should correctly parse standard Settings.xml files. The error message "Could not determine LTR/RTL from settings. Could not determine script/language from settings." implies that either: a. The Settings.xml file is missing or not parsable by the library for some projects. b. The settings object returned by settings_parser.parse() is None or doesn't have the expected attributes (is_right_to_left, script, language_name).

The current hasattr checks are good for handling cases where attributes might be missing on a successfully parsed settings object. However, if settings_parser.parse() returns None, the hasattr checks will still proceed on a None object, which is fine but doesn't tell us why it's None.

Issue 2 & 3: Book ID and Token Processing

The core of the problem with TotalBooksProcessed being 0 and no per-book stats likely lies in how current_book_id_for_file is managed and when processed_book_ids.add(current_book_id_for_file) is called.

\id Marker: The book ID is typically set by an \id marker, which should produce a UsfmToken with type == UsfmTokenType.BOOK and text containing the book code (e.g., "GEN").
Timing: If text tokens are processed before an \id (BOOK) token is encountered in a file, active_book_id_for_counting would be None, and thus SFM markers and punctuation for that text wouldn't be attributed to any book. Words, however, are collected into a project-global list (AllWordsInProject) and don't strictly require an active book ID at the moment of collection for the shortest/longest word analysis (though it's good practice).
Proposed Changes:

Refine Settings Error Handling: Add more specific logging if settings_parser.parse() returns None to understand if it's a common issue or specific to certain projects.
Ensure Book ID Context:
Make sure that processed_book_ids.add(current_book_id_for_file) is only called when current_book_id_for_file is not None.
The logic for active_book_id_for_counting seems correct, but we need to ensure current_book_id_for_file is reliably set by UsfmTokenType.BOOK tokens.
Marker Identification: The UsfmToken object has a marker attribute which directly gives the marker string (e.g., "id", "c", "v", "p"). We should prefer using token.marker when available and it's a marker type. token.text for a UsfmTokenType.BOOK token contains the book ID (e.g., "GEN"), not the marker "\id". For other marker types, token.text might contain the marker if token.marker is None or less specific.
Let's apply these refinements.

Explanation of Key Changes:

Settings Parsing Diagnostics (Lines 136-144):

If settings_parser.parse() returns None, a more specific warning message is now printed and added to ErrorMessage. This helps distinguish between a completely unparsable Settings.xml and one that parses but lacks specific attributes.
The Exception block also has a more specific message.
Book ID Processing (Lines 178-181):

current_book_id_for_file = token.text.strip().upper(): Ensures any leading/trailing whitespace is removed from the book ID obtained from token.text for UsfmTokenType.BOOK.
if current_book_id_for_file: processed_book_ids.add(current_book_id_for_file): This explicitly checks that current_book_id_for_file is not an empty string before adding it to processed_book_ids. This is crucial. If an \id marker is present but has no following book code (which would be invalid USFM but could happen), this prevents an empty string from being considered a processed book.
SFM Marker Identification (Lines 189-197):

The logic to determine actual_marker_tag is refined:
It now prioritizes token.marker. The .marker attribute of a UsfmToken is specifically designed to hold the marker string (e.g., "id", "c", "v", "p", "wj").
It converts the marker to lowercase (actual_marker_tag = token.marker.lower()) for consistent counting, as USFM markers are case-insensitive in practice.
A fallback to token.text is kept but explicitly avoids using token.text if the token.type is UsfmTokenType.BOOK because, for book tokens, token.text is the book code (e.g., "GEN"), not the marker "\id".
Further Debugging Steps if Issues Persist:

Inspect Settings.xml: For a project like "aai" that gives the settings error, manually open its Settings.xml file.
Does it exist?
Is it well-formed XML?
Does it contain elements like <Direction>, <LanguageName>, <Script> that FileParatextProjectSettingsParser would look for? (The exact tags might vary, but is_right_to_left is usually derived from a direction tag).
Examine USFM Files: For a project where TotalBooksProcessed is 0:
Open one of its .SFM or .usfm files.
Is there an \id marker at the beginning (e.g., \id GEN)?
Is it correctly formatted?
Detailed Token Logging (Temporary): If problems with book IDs or markers continue, you could temporarily add more detailed print statements inside the for token in usfm_tokens: loop to see exactly what sil-machine is producing for each token:
python
# Inside the loop, for debugging:
# print(f"DBG: File: {usfm_file_path.name}, BookCtx: {current_book_id_for_file}, Token Type: {token.type}, Token Marker: '{token.marker}', Token Text: '{token.text}', Token Data: '{token.data}'")
This will be very verbose but can be invaluable for seeing the raw token stream. Remember to remove or comment this out after debugging.
These changes should improve the robustness of settings parsing and the accuracy of book and marker identification.

Let's leave the Settings.xml for the moment. We can come back to that later. The output from the DBG print statement shows that the BookCtx is always None. Here is a sample of the output that looks like the end of JHN Chapter 17 and the beginning of JHN Chapter 18.

It's good that we're focusing on the BookCtx: None issue, as that's fundamental to getting the per-book statistics.

The DBG output clearly shows that even when a UsfmTokenType.CHAPTER token is encountered (like Token Marker: 'c', ... Token Data: '18'), the BookCtx remains None. This strongly suggests that the \id marker, which is supposed to set the initial book context for a file, is either:

Not present at the beginning of the 44JHNaai.SFM file.
Present but not being tokenized as UsfmTokenType.BOOK by the UsfmTokenizer.
Being tokenized as UsfmTokenType.BOOK, but its token.text (which should contain the book ID like "JHN") is empty or None.
Looking at the UsfmParser code you provided (which is the internal parser used by UsfmTokenizer and other components, not directly by your script's tokenizer.tokenize() call but illustrative of how sil-machine handles USFM), the \id marker is handled like this:

python
# From machine.corpora.usfm_parser.py (UsfmParser.process_token)
        elif token_type == UsfmTokenType.BOOK:
            assert token.marker is not None # This would be 'id'
            self.state.push(UsfmParserElement(UsfmElementType.BOOK, token.marker))

            # Code is always upper case
            assert token.data is not None # This should be the book code like "JHN"
            code = token.data.upper()

            # Update verse ref. Leave book alone if not empty to prevent parsing errors on books with bad id lines.
            verse_ref = self.state.verse_ref
            if verse_ref.book == "" and book_id_to_number(code) != 0:
                verse_ref.book = code
            # ...
Use code with care. Learn more
The UsfmTokenizer itself is responsible for producing these UsfmToken objects. When it encounters \id GEN ..., it should yield a UsfmToken where:

token.type is UsfmTokenType.BOOK
token.marker is "id"
token.text is "GEN" (this is the crucial part for your script's logic current_book_id_for_file = token.text.strip().upper())
token.data might also be "GEN" or related information depending on the tokenizer's specifics for this type.
Your script's logic for setting current_book_id_for_file is:

python
                if token.type == UsfmTokenType.BOOK and token.text:
                    # token.text for BOOK type is the book code (e.g., "GEN")
                    current_book_id_for_file = token.text.strip().upper()
                    if current_book_id_for_file: # Ensure it's not empty
                        processed_book_ids.add(current_book_id_for_file)
This relies on token.text being populated with the book code when token.type == UsfmTokenType.BOOK.

Hypothesis:

The UsfmTokenizer might be setting the book code into token.data for UsfmTokenType.BOOK tokens, and token.text might be None or empty for these specific tokens. The UsfmParser example uses token.data for the book code.

Let's test this hypothesis by modifying your script to check token.data as well for UsfmTokenType.BOOK.

If token.text is indeed None for BOOK tokens from UsfmTokenizer, then current_book_id_for_file would never be set, leading to BookCtx: None throughout the file processing.

                        processed_book_ids.add(current_book_id_for_file)


Explanation of the Change:

Modified Book ID Extraction (Lines 183-190 in project_analyser.py):
When token.type == UsfmTokenType.BOOK:
It now first checks token.text. If token.text has a non-empty stripped value, that's used as the book_code_candidate.
If token.text is empty or None, it then checks token.data. If token.data has a non-empty stripped value, that's used.
This book_code_candidate then becomes current_book_id_for_file.
What to Check After This Change:

Run the script again with the DBG print statement active.

Look at the very first few tokens for each SFM file. You should see an \id marker.
When Token Type: UsfmTokenType.BOOK appears for the \id line:
Is Token Text populated with the book ID (e.g., "JHN")?
Is Token Data populated with the book ID?
Crucially, does BookCtx get set to the correct book ID immediately after this BOOK token?
If BookCtx starts getting populated correctly, then the subsequent SFM marker and punctuation counts should also start being attributed to the correct books, and TotalBooksProcessed should reflect the actual number of unique book IDs found.

If BookCtx still remains None, then we'd need to look even more closely at the very first tokens of an SFM file to see if the \id marker is being missed or misinterpreted entirely by the UsfmTokenizer. In that case, examining the raw content of the SFM file's first few lines would be the next step.

The first line of the file 44JHNaai.sfm file is \id JHN - Miniafia NT; David and Fran Wakefield; Stanley Oyabua; Josiah; 29-Jul-2010 (web edition -2012 bd) It's very common for the \id JHN to be followed by more title data. The machine libraray should deal with that.

I put a sys.exit(0) to stop the code once a book token was found. That was the first token printed by the debug, for a Glossary book. DBG: File: 110GLOaai.SFM, BookCtx: None, Token Type: UsfmTokenType.BOOK, Token Marker: 'id', Token Text: 'None', Token Data: 'GLO' (We could get the code to ignore non-cannonical books).


Gemini
It's great that you've confirmed the \id line format and the debug output for a BOOK token!

The debug line: DBG: File: 110GLOaai.SFM, BookCtx: None, Token Type: UsfmTokenType.BOOK, Token Marker: 'id', Token Text: 'None', Token Data: 'GLO'

This is very revealing. It shows that for a UsfmTokenType.BOOK token:

token.marker is correctly identified as 'id'.
token.text is 'None' (or the string "None", or the Python None object - the quotes in your DBG output suggest it's a string representation of Python's None).
token.data correctly contains the book code 'GLO'.
This confirms our hypothesis from the previous step: the UsfmTokenizer (or the underlying parsing mechanism it uses) places the actual book identifier (like "GLO", "JHN") into the token.data attribute for UsfmTokenType.BOOK tokens, and token.text is not reliably populated with this information for this token type.

Your previous change was on the right track by checking token.data. Let's ensure it correctly assigns current_book_id_for_file. The sys.exit(0) was a good test to isolate the first BOOK token.

The logic for book_code_candidate was:

python
                    book_code_candidate = None
                    if token.text and token.text.strip():
                        book_code_candidate = token.text.strip().upper()
                    elif token.data and token.data.strip(): # Fallback to token.data
                        book_code_candidate = token.data.strip().upper()
                    
                    current_book_id_for_file = book_code_candidate
Given the DBG output where token.text is 'None' (as a string or Python None) and token.data is 'GLO', this logic should work:

token.text ('None') when stripped might still be 'None' or empty, so the first if condition might be false or book_code_candidate remains None.
The elif token.data and token.data.strip(): should then catch 'GLO', strip it (no change), uppercase it (no change), and assign 'GLO' to book_code_candidate.
current_book_id_for_file should then become 'GLO'.
The sys.exit(0) would then execute. If you remove the sys.exit(0), the subsequent DBG print statements for that same file (110GLOaai.SFM) should show BookCtx: GLO.

Let's refine the book ID extraction slightly to be more robust against token.text literally being the string "None" and remove the sys.exit(0) to see the full flow.

Also, you mentioned ignoring non-canonical books. We can add a check for that easily using the BOOK_ORDER list.

Key Changes and Rationale:

Book ID Extraction (Lines 186-196):
Now prioritizes token.data because the DBG output showed it reliably contains the book code ('GLO').
It checks if token.data is a non-empty string before using it.
The fallback to token.text also checks if it's a string and explicitly avoids using it if its uppercase version is "NONE", to prevent current_book_id_for_file from becoming "NONE".
Non-Canonical Book Handling (Lines 191-195):
After a book_code_candidate is determined, it's checked against the BOOK_ORDER list.
If the book code is not in BOOK_ORDER (e.g., "GLO" if you decide to exclude it), a message is printed.
current_book_id_for_file is explicitly set to None.
A continue statement is added. This will skip the rest of the current iteration of the for token in usfm_tokens: loop. This means if you want to completely ignore all markers and text within non-canonical books, this continue is appropriate. If you still want to, for example, count words from non-canonical books for the project-wide shortest/longest list (but not attribute markers/punctuation to them), you would remove this continue but keep current_book_id_for_file = None so they aren't counted in per-book stats. For now, I've included the continue to fully skip them.
sys.exit(0): Ensure this is commented out or removed for the script to process beyond the first book token.
Next Steps:

Apply the diff.
Crucially, remove or comment out the sys.exit(0) that was used for testing.
Remove or comment out the [:10] slice on for token in usfm_tokens: if it's still there.
Run the script again.
Observe the DBG output (if you keep it active for a bit longer):
Does BookCtx now get set correctly after an \id line (e.g., to "JHN" for 44JHNaai.SFM, or "GLO" for 110GLOaai.SFM if you don't skip it)?
Does it remain set for subsequent tokens within that same file?
Check the final Excel output:
Is TotalBooksProcessed now greater than 0?
Are SFM markers and punctuation counts appearing for the processed books?
This refined logic for extracting the book ID from the UsfmToken should resolve the BookCtx: None issue. The optional handling for non-canonical books gives you control over what gets included in the detailed analysis.

This processed all the projects and files without printing any DBG statements!


Gemini
That's excellent progress! It means the core loop for finding projects, iterating through USFM files, and tokenizing them is now running without hitting immediate crashes. The fact that the DBG statements didn't print suggests they might have been commented out or removed, which is fine if the script completed.

The next crucial step is to verify the correctness of the output. Since the BookCtx was previously None, the main things to check in your generated Excel files are:

TotalBooksProcessed in project_analysis_summary.xlsx:

Is this number now greater than 0 for projects that you know have USFM files with \id markers?
Does it accurately reflect the number of unique, canonical book codes found in each project?
Detailed Per-Project Reports ({ProjectName}_details.xlsx):

SFM_Markers_By_Book sheet:
Are there rows for SFM markers and columns for Book IDs (like GEN, EXO, JHN)?
Are the counts in the cells non-zero and plausible?
Punctuation_By_Book sheet:
Are there rows for Unicode punctuation names and columns for Book IDs?
Are the counts sensible?
Project_Metadata sheet:
Does the TotalBooksProcessed here match the summary?
If the TotalBooksProcessed is still 0 or very low, and the per-book sheets are empty or missing data for canonical books:

This would indicate that even with the refined logic for token.data, current_book_id_for_file is not being set correctly or consistently.

Here are a few things to double-check in the project_analyser.py code, specifically within the analyze_project_data function's token processing loop:

DBG Print Statement:

Ensure the print(f"DBG: ...") line is uncommented if you need to re-verify the token stream for a specific problematic project. You can even add more targeted DBG prints right after current_book_id_for_file is assigned to see its value.
Non-Canonical Book Skipping Logic:

project_analyser.py
# f:\GitHub\davidbaines\project_analyser\project_analyser\project_analyser.py
# ...
                if book_code_candidate:
                    # Optional: Check if the book is in our canonical list
                    if book_code_candidate not in BOOK_ORDER:
                        print(f"Info: Skipping non-canonical book '{book_code_candidate}' found in {usfm_file_path.name}.")
                        current_book_id_for_file = None # Ensure context is cleared for non-canonical
                        continue # Skip processing tokens for this non-canonical book further if desired
                    current_book_id_for_file = book_code_candidate
                    processed_book_ids.add(current_book_id_for_file)
# ...
If BOOK_ORDER is too restrictive or if book codes in your projects have slight variations (e.g., "JN" instead of "JHN") that aren't in BOOK_ORDER, they would be skipped.
The continue statement means that no tokens (SFM markers, text for words/punctuation) will be processed for that file after a non-canonical book ID is encountered. If an SFM file starts with a non-canonical book ID (like "GLO" if "GLO" is not in BOOK_ORDER), then nothing from that file will contribute to the per-book stats.
Suggestion for a quick test if TotalBooksProcessed is still an issue:

Temporarily comment out the non-canonical book check to see if any book IDs get processed:

                        # sys.exit(0) # Make sure this is removed for full processing

If, after this change, TotalBooksProcessed increases and you start seeing data for books (even non-canonical ones like "GLO"), then the issue was likely related to the BOOK_ORDER check or the continue statement's effect. You can then decide how strictly you want to enforce the BOOK_ORDER list.

If TotalBooksProcessed still remains 0 even with the canonical check disabled, then the problem is more fundamental in how book_code_candidate is being derived from token.data or token.text for UsfmTokenType.BOOK tokens, or if such tokens are even being yielded by the tokenizer for your files. In that scenario, reactivating the DBG print and focusing on the very first few tokens of a known SFM file (like 44JHNaai.SFM) would be necessary.

Yes the Total number of books processed looks correct in the summary sheet, and the Cannonical books processed in the details sheet look correct. There are rows for SFM markers and columns for the books, and the punctuation by book sheet looks correct too. This is really excellent! Thanks.


Gemini
That's fantastic news! I'm thrilled to hear that the script is now correctly processing the projects, identifying canonical books, and generating the SFM marker and punctuation statistics in the desired format. It's always a great feeling when the data starts flowing correctly after working through the intricacies of parsing and logic.

Since the core functionality for book processing, SFM marker counting, and punctuation analysis seems to be working well, we can consider a few minor refinements or next steps if you're interested:

Settings.xml Parsing (Revisit):

You mentioned leaving this for later. When you're ready, we can revisit why FileParatextProjectSettingsParser might not be extracting LTR/RTL or script information for some projects. This often involves looking at the specific structure of the Settings.xml files in those projects and comparing them to what the parser expects. Sometimes, Paratext versions or custom configurations can lead to variations.
Error Message Consolidation:

In analyze_project_data, when multiple warnings occur (e.g., for LTR/RTL and script settings), the ErrorMessage string gets appended to. This is fine, but for very long error messages in the summary, you might consider a more structured way to store multiple warnings if it becomes an issue, though for now, simple concatenation is likely sufficient.
Efficiency for Very Large Projects/Files:

For extremely large USFM files, reading the entire content = file.read() into memory at once could be memory-intensive. UsfmTokenizer can also accept an iterable of lines, which could allow for line-by-line processing if memory becomes a concern on massive files. However, for most Paratext projects, reading the whole file is usually acceptable and simpler. This is more of a "keep in mind if you hit limits" point.
Extending BOOK_ORDER:

If you encounter projects with valid but less common deuterocanonical or extra books that you do want to include as "canonical" for your analysis, you can simply add their standard three-letter codes to the BOOK_ORDER list.
User Feedback for Non-Canonical Skipping:

The print(f"Info: Skipping non-canonical book '{book_code_candidate}'...") is good. If this becomes very verbose for projects with many non-canonical books (like glossaries, introductions in separate files), you could consider summarizing this at the end of a project's analysis or logging it to a separate file if it clutters the main console output too much.
None of these are urgent if the current output meets your needs, but they are potential areas for future polish or extension.

It's been a pleasure working through this with you. You've provided excellent feedback and testing, which is key to refining complex scripts like this. Well done on getting it to this stage!

Let me know if anything else comes up or if you decide to tackle one of those pending items like the Settings.xml parsing.

This is great. I need to add an option --details_in_output that will not write the detailed project xlsx files to the project folders, but will instead write them to a folder given in the .env file as DETAILS_OUTPUT_FOLDER


Gemini
Okay, that's a useful feature to keep your main output folder cleaner if you have many projects!

Here's how we can implement the --details_in_output option and use the DETAILS_OUTPUT_FOLDER from your .env file:

We'll add a new command-line argument --details_in_output.
We'll read DETAILS_OUTPUT_FOLDER from your .env file.
In the main function, we'll determine where to save the detailed report based on whether the flag is set and the DETAILS_OUTPUT_FOLDER is available.
The path to the detailed report will then be correctly reflected in the summary sheet.

Key Changes:

.env and Argument Parsing (main function):

Reads DETAILS_OUTPUT_FOLDER from .env into default_details_output_folder.
Adds a new command-line argument --details_output_folder that can override the .env value.
Adds the boolean flag --details_in_output.
Includes a check: if --details_in_output is set but no details_output_folder is available (neither from arg nor .env), it prints a warning and defaults to saving details in the main output folder.
Ensures the details_output_folder is created if it's going to be used.
Determining Detailed Report Path (main function):

actual_detailed_report_folder is determined based on args.details_in_output and args.details_output_folder.
detailed_report_path (the full path to the specific project's detailed file) is constructed using this actual_detailed_report_folder. This path is used for checking if the file exists (for the --force logic).
Storing Actual Path (main function):

current_project_data["ActualDetailedReportPath"] = detailed_report_path is added. This stores the true location where the detailed report will be (or was) saved.
Calling generate_detailed_project_report (main function):

It now passes actual_detailed_report_folder instead of args.output_folder as the base directory for saving the detailed report.
Summary Report (generate_master_summary_report function):

The line for PathToDetailedReport is changed to: entry["PathToDetailedReport"] = proj_data.get("ActualDetailedReportPath", "") This ensures the summary report accurately reflects where each detailed file was saved.
How to Use:

Make sure your .env file has the DETAILS_OUTPUT_FOLDER line if you want to use it by default:
properties
PROJECTS_FOLDER=C:\ebible_data\projects
OUTPUT_FOLDER=F:\Corpora\projects_summary
DETAILS_OUTPUT_FOLDER=F:\Corpora\projects_summary\projects_details
Run the script:
Without the flag (current behavior): python project_analyser.py (Detailed reports go into OUTPUT_FOLDER)
With the flag (new behavior, using .env for details folder): python project_analyser.py --details_in_output (Detailed reports go into DETAILS_OUTPUT_FOLDER)
With the flag and overriding details folder: python project_analyser.py --details_in_output --details_output_folder D:\MyOtherDetailReports (Detailed reports go into D:\MyOtherDetailReports)
This should give you the flexibility you need for organizing the output files!

Can we improve the logic for setting the --details_in_output. I'm thinking that if the DETAILS_OUTPUT_FOLDER is set in the env we can use that. It can be commented out if not required. The code would know to use that if it is present or if a --details_output argument is present with a folder. Is that clear and a good way to simplify the code?


Gemini
That's a good idea for simplifying the logic around where detailed reports are saved!

Here's how we can adjust it:

The presence of a DETAILS_OUTPUT_FOLDER (either from the .env file or the --details_output_folder command-line argument) will be the sole trigger for saving detailed reports to that specific folder. The --details_in_output flag will no longer be necessary.

Revised Logic:

The script will attempt to get DETAILS_OUTPUT_FOLDER first from the command-line argument (--details_output_folder).
If not provided via command-line, it will try to get it from the .env file.
If a DETAILS_OUTPUT_FOLDER is determined (either way), detailed reports will be saved there.
If no DETAILS_OUTPUT_FOLDER is specified (neither by argument nor in .env), detailed reports will be saved in the main OUTPUT_FOLDER.
This makes the configuration more straightforward: if you want details in a separate location, you specify that location; otherwise, they go with the summary.

Explanation of Changes:

Command-Line Argument Simplification:

The --details_in_output flag and its associated help text are removed from parser.add_argument.
The help text for --details_output_folder is updated to reflect the new behavior: "If specified, detailed reports go here, otherwise they go to the main output_folder."
Logic in main() for actual_detailed_report_folder:

The if args.details_in_output and not args.details_output_folder: block (which handled the warning and sys.exit(0)) is removed as it's no longer needed.
The logic to determine actual_detailed_report_folder is simplified to:
python
actual_detailed_report_folder = args.details_output_folder if args.details_output_folder else args.output_folder
This means: if args.details_output_folder has a value (from command-line or .env), use that. Otherwise, use args.output_folder.
The os.makedirs call for args.details_output_folder is now conditional on args.details_output_folder actually having a value.
This approach is indeed clearer and simplifies the command-line interface. Users now only need to think about where they want the detailed reports, and if they don't specify a separate location, the reports naturally go with the main summary output.

This is working great. Thanks. There's a bit of debugging to do though. In the shortest words there are quite often digits 1 2 3 10 etc. It would be good to exclude those from being considered as word-forming. I'm also seeing some odd "Shortest words": kind, orait, share, notice these appear in a few of the test cases as shortest words even though they don't seem to appear in the verse text any where. One thing we can do to help with this is to ensure that the words and punctuation that we consider are only the words and punctuation from Verse text and not the words from other markers.

You've hit on some excellent points for refining the data quality! It's common in text analysis to iterate on what constitutes a "word" and from which contexts data should be collected.

Let's address these:

Excluding Digits from Words: We'll modify is_word_char to exclude characters that are purely digits (Unicode category 'Nd' - Number, Decimal Digit).
Contextual Word and Punctuation Collection: We'll implement logic to ensure that words and punctuation are primarily collected from what can be identified as verse text, rather than from headings, notes, or other non-verse USFM elements.
Here's how we can implement these changes:

1. Modifying is_word_char

We'll add a condition to is_word_char to return False if the character's Unicode category is 'Nd'.

2. Contextual Collection (Focusing on Verse Text)

We'll introduce a state variable, currently_in_verse_text_block, within the analyze_project_data function.

This flag will be initialized to False at the start of processing each USFM file's tokens.
It will be set to True when a UsfmTokenType.VERSE token (like \v) is encountered.
It will be set to False when tokens indicating a different block type are encountered (e.g., UsfmTokenType.BOOK, UsfmTokenType.CHAPTER, UsfmTokenType.PARAGRAPH for markers like \p, \s, \q, \mt, etc., or UsfmTokenType.NOTE for markers like \f, \x).
Words and punctuation will only be collected if this flag is True AND the current token is UsfmTokenType.TEXT.
The text sample for script detection will also only be collected under this condition.
This approach helps to filter out content from section headings (\s), introductory material (\imt), notes (\f), etc., from being included in your primary word and punctuation counts.

Explanation of Changes:

is_word_char(char) (Lines 61-68):

Added if category == 'Nd': return False to explicitly exclude decimal digits from being considered part of a word.
Removed category.startswith('N') as 'Nd' is now handled, and other 'N' categories (like 'No' - Number, Other; 'Nl' - Number, Letter) might still be desired in some contexts (e.g., Roman numerals used as words, or numbers in some orthographies). If you want to exclude all Unicode Number categories, you could change it back to not category.startswith('N') or be more specific. For now, only 'Nd' is excluded.
analyze_project_data Function:

currently_in_verse_text_block (Line 200): Initialized to False at the start of processing each new USFM file.
Updating Context (Lines 224-232):
When token.type == UsfmTokenType.VERSE, currently_in_verse_text_block is set to True.
When token.type is BOOK, CHAPTER, PARAGRAPH, or NOTE, currently_in_verse_text_block is set to False. This means subsequent TEXT tokens will not be processed for words/punctuation until the next VERSE token.
Conditional Text Processing (Line 249):
The entire block for processing UsfmTokenType.TEXT tokens is now conditional: if token.type == UsfmTokenType.TEXT and token.text and currently_in_verse_text_block:.
Conditional Script Sample Collection (Line 252):
text_sample_for_script_detection.append(text_content) is now only done if currently_in_verse_text_block is true (the active_book_id_for_counting check was removed here as the block itself is already conditional on verse text context).
Word and Punctuation Collection (Lines 257-269):
The logic for appending to project_results["AllWordsInProject"] and adding to punctuation counters is now implicitly within the if currently_in_verse_text_block: due to the outer condition on line 249. The individual checks within the loop over char_in_text were slightly redundant given the outer block condition, but the structure is kept for clarity. The main point is that text_content itself is now only from verse text blocks.
Regarding the "odd shortest words" like "kind", "orait", "share", "notice":

The new contextual collection should significantly help. If these words were appearing in section headings (\s markers, which are UsfmTokenType.PARAGRAPH), introductions, or notes, they should now be excluded from AllWordsInProject.
If they still appear, it would be worth manually searching for them in the USFM files of the projects where they are reported as shortest words to see their exact context. It's possible they are indeed very short words used in the verse text of those particular translations.
After applying these changes, regenerate your reports. The list of shortest words should be cleaner, and the overall word/punctuation statistics should more accurately reflect the content of the verse text itself.

Some projects represent the project at a certain date. They contain _yyyy_mm_dd in their project folder name. There may be several of these with different dates. Can we add a function to get the list of folders that 'look like' paratext projects - then for those that have no date in the name add them to the list to be processed. For those that have a date in the name find only the latest project and analyse only that one.


Gemini
That's a very practical requirement for handling Paratext project folders, especially when dealing with archives or backups that include dates in their names!

We can modify the get_project_paths function to implement this logic. Here's the strategy:

Initial Scan: First, scan the base_folder for all directories that look like Paratext projects (using your existing is_paratext_folder logic from find_projects.py, which is more robust than the one currently in project_analyser.py).
Categorize by Base Name: For each found project path, extract a "base name" by removing any _yyyy_mm_dd suffix.
Group by Base Name: Group the project paths by these base names.
Select Latest Dated or Undated:
If a group contains only one project path and it has no date suffix, select it.
If a group contains multiple project paths, and some have date suffixes, select the one with the latest date.
If a group contains an undated version and dated versions, the "latest" would typically be the undated one unless you specifically want the latest dated backup. For now, let's assume if an undated one exists alongside dated ones for the same base name, the undated one is the primary one to process. If you prefer the latest dated one even if an undated one exists, we can adjust. A common scenario is that the undated one is the "live" project.
Let's integrate a more robust is_paratext_folder check (similar to your find_projects.py) and then implement the date-based selection logic.

First, I'll define the regex for the date pattern. Then, I'll update get_project_paths.

Explanation of Changes:

Import re: Added import re for regular expression matching.
is_paratext_project_folder function (Lines 78-94):
This function is now more aligned with the logic from your find_projects.py.
It checks for Settings.xml.
It then checks for the presence of either *.sfm or *.usfm files (case-insensitive suffix check).
DATE_SUFFIX_PATTERN (Line 97):
A regular expression is defined to capture two common date suffix patterns:
_yyyy_mm_dd (e.g., MyProject_2023_01_15)
_yyyymmdd (e.g., MyProject_20230115)
It captures the base project name and the date parts.
get_project_paths function (Lines 99-131):
Initial Scan: It iterates through items in base_folder and uses is_paratext_project_folder to get a list of candidate_paths.
Group by Base Name:
It creates projects_by_base_name, a defaultdict(list).
For each candidate_path, it tries to match the DATE_SUFFIX_PATTERN.
If a date suffix is found, the base name and the parsed datetime object are stored.
If no date suffix is found, the full name is used as the base name, and date is stored as None.
Select Final Paths:
It iterates through projects_by_base_name.
For each base name, it separates versions into undated_versions and dated_versions.
dated_versions are sorted by date in descending order (latest first).
Selection Logic:
If there's an undated_version (e.g., MyProject), it's preferred and added to final_project_paths. This assumes the undated version is the primary or "live" one.
If there are no undated versions but there are dated_versions, the one with the latest date (the first one in the sorted list) is selected.
Returns final_project_paths (list of strings, as the rest of your script expects strings).
To Integrate:

Replace the existing get_project_paths function in your project_analyser.py file with this new version.
Make sure import re is at the top of your project_analyser.py file.
Consideration for "Latest":

The current logic prefers an undated project over any dated ones if they share the same base name. For example, if you have:

MyProject
MyProject_2023_01_01
MyProject_2024_01_01
The script will select MyProject.

If you would instead prefer MyProject_2024_01_01 in this scenario (i.e., always the absolute latest, whether dated or not, considering undated as "older" or "current but not specifically snapshotted"), the selection logic would need a slight adjustment. Let me know if that's your preference. For now, the implemented logic is a common approach.

Yes, in the consideration of latest, the latest dated folder is usually the latest, and the undated folder usually the earliest. Could we add a bit of feedback (using tqdm perhaps) during the scanning for folders. I'm now scanning hundreds of folders and so it would be good to see what is happening a bit more.


Gemini
You're absolutely right, for a large number of folders, some feedback during the scanning process would be very helpful! tqdm is an excellent choice for this.

We'll also adjust the logic for selecting the "latest" project to prioritize dated versions over undated ones if both exist for the same base name.

Here's how we can integrate tqdm and modify the project selection logic:

Install tqdm: If you haven't already, you'll need to install it: pip install tqdm
Import tqdm: Add from tqdm import tqdm to your script.
Wrap os.listdir: In get_project_paths, we'll wrap the os.listdir(base_folder) loop with tqdm to show progress while iterating through potential project folders.
Adjust "Latest" Logic: Modify the selection part of get_project_paths to prefer the latest dated version. If only undated versions exist, it will pick one of those.

        # If neither (should not happen if versions list is not empty), nothing is added for this base_name
            
    return final_project_paths

Explanation of Changes:

Import tqdm (Line 12):

from tqdm import tqdm is added.
Progress Bar in get_project_paths (Line 115):

The loop for item_name in os.listdir(base_folder): is changed to: for item_name in tqdm(os.listdir(base_folder), desc="Scanning project folders"):
This will display a progress bar in the console as the script iterates through the items in your PROJECTS_FOLDER. The desc argument provides a label for the progress bar.
Modified "Latest" Selection Logic (Lines 133-138):

The selection logic is now:
python
if dated_versions: # Prefer latest dated version if it exists
    final_project_paths.append(str(dated_versions[0]["path"]))
elif undated_versions: # Otherwise, take an undated version if one exists
    final_project_paths.append(str(undated_versions[0]["path"]))
This prioritizes the latest dated version. If no dated versions are found for a base name, but an undated one exists, the undated one will be chosen.
Now, when you run the script, you should see a progress bar during the initial phase where it's identifying potential Paratext project folders. This will give you much better feedback on what's happening, especially with a large number of directories to check. The project selection logic will also align with your preference for the latest dated version.

I'd like to be able to query the data in the project_detailled.xlsx files. There could be several queries that would be useful. One of the first queries is given a subset of markers (\p \q \q1 \q2 \q3) which projects contain the most of these, and within those projects which books contain the most. A similar question I would like to answer from the data is which projects and books contain the greatest number of punctuation characters that contain the word "QUOTATION" in their name.


Gemini
That's a great idea to leverage the detailed data you're already collecting! Querying the generated XLSX files can provide powerful insights without needing to re-parse the USFM data.

We can create a new Python script, let's call it query_project_data.py, that will:

Read the project_analysis_summary.xlsx to get a list of projects and paths to their detailed reports.
For each detailed report ({ProjectName}_details.xlsx):
Read the "SFM_Markers_By_Book" sheet.
Read the "Punctuation_By_Book" sheet.
Aggregate the data according to the query.
Present the results.
Let's start by building the framework for this query script and implement the two specific queries you mentioned:

Query 1: Given a subset of markers (e.g., \p, \q, \q1, \q2, \q3), find which projects and books contain the most of these. Query 2: Find which projects and books contain the greatest number of punctuation characters that have "QUOTATION" in their Unicode name.

How to Create and Use query_project_data.py:

Save the Code: Save the code above into a new file named query_project_data.py in the same directory as your project_analyser.py (or any location from where you can run it).
Ensure Dependencies: Make sure you have pandas, python-dotenv, and tqdm installed in your Python environment. If you used openpyxl for project_analyser.py, pandas will use it for reading Excel files.
Run from Command Line:
Query for specific markers:
bash
python query_project_data.py --query_markers "\p,\q,\q1,\q2,\q3" 
You can also specify the output folder if it's different from your .env setting:
bash
python query_project_data.py --output_folder path/to/your/output --query_markers "\p,\q"
And control the number of results:
bash
python query_project_data.py --query_markers "\p" --top_n_projects 10 --top_n_books 5
Query for "QUOTATION" punctuation:
bash
python query_project_data.py --query_quotation_punctuation
Run both queries:
bash
python query_project_data.py --query_markers "\p,\q" --query_quotation_punctuation
Explanation:

main() function:
Parses command-line arguments for the output folder (where project_analysis_summary.xlsx resides), the markers to query, whether to query quotation punctuation, and how many top results to show.
Loads the summary DataFrame.
Calls the respective query functions based on the arguments.
query_marker_usage() function:
Takes the summary DataFrame, a list of target_markers, and top_n parameters.
Iterates through each project listed in the summary.
For each project, it tries to load the "SFM_Markers_By_Book" sheet from its detailed XLSX file.
This sheet is expected to have SFM markers as the index and Book IDs as columns.
It sums the counts for the target_markers across all books for each project to get a project total.
It also stores book-level details for the target markers.
Finally, it prints the top N projects and, for each of those, the top N books with their counts of the target markers.
query_quotation_punctuation() function:
Similar structure to query_marker_usage().
It loads the "Punctuation_By_Book" sheet (which has UnicodeName as index, BookIDs as columns).
It filters the index (punctuation names) for those containing "QUOTATION" (case-insensitive).
It aggregates counts for these quotation-related punctuation marks at the project and book levels.
Prints the top N projects and their top N books for quotation punctuation usage.
Error Handling & Progress:
Includes try-except blocks for reading Excel files.
Uses tqdm to show progress while iterating through projects.
Prints warnings if detailed files are missing or cannot be processed.
This script provides a good starting point for your queries. You can expand it with more query types as needed by adding new functions similar to the existing ones and corresponding command-line arguments.

Looking back to the main script project_analyser.py can you see a bug that would cause any of the counting to be incorrect?

project_analyser.py: 1 lines selected

Gemini
Okay, let's take a close look at project_analyser.py for potential counting bugs, especially focusing on how words, SFM markers, and punctuation are collected and aggregated.

Based on the provided code, here are a few areas that could lead to incorrect counts or misinterpretations:

Duplicate PunctuationByBook Initialization:

In the project_results dictionary initialization within analyze_project_data, PunctuationByBook is listed twice. This isn't a functional bug that would cause a crash, as the second one would just overwrite the first. However, it's redundant.
python
# ...
        # Detailed data
        "SFMMarkersByBook": defaultdict(Counter),  # {book_id: Counter(marker: count)}
        "PunctuationByBook": defaultdict(Counter), # {book_id: Counter(punct: count)} # First instance
        "PunctuationByBook": defaultdict(Counter), # {book_id: {char: count}}      # Second instance - redundant
        "PunctuationByNameAndBook": defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int)), # {unicode_name: {book_id: count}}
        "AllWordsInProject": [], # Temp list to collect all words for shortest/longest
# ...
Word Collection at the End of text_content Block:

The logic to catch a word at the end of a text_content block is present, but it's important to ensure current_word is correctly managed across multiple UsfmToken objects within the same row.segment (if sil-machine ever splits what a human considers a single "text run" across multiple TEXT tokens, though this is less common for UsfmTokenizer). The current logic seems to handle it per token.text block, which is generally correct.
python
# ...
                    if is_word_char(char_in_text):
                        current_word += char_in_text
                    else:
                        if current_word: # A word was just completed
                            project_results["AllWordsInProject"].append(current_word.lower())
                            current_word = ""
                        # ... punctuation handling ...

                if current_word: # Catch any word at the end of the text_content block
                    project_results["AllWordsInProject"].append(current_word.lower())
                    current_word = "" # Reset for next token or text segment
# ...
This looks okay, as current_word is reset after being appended. The main concern would be if currently_in_verse_text_block changes state between characters of a word, but UsfmToken objects are usually granular enough that this isn't an issue.

SFM Marker Tag Normalization/Identification:

The logic for actual_marker_tag is:
python
                actual_marker_tag = None
                if token.marker:
                    actual_marker_tag = token.marker.lower() # Normalize to lowercase
                elif token.text and token.type != UsfmTokenType.BOOK: # Fallback for some cases, but avoid using book ID as marker
                    actual_marker_tag = token.text.lower()

                if actual_marker_tag: 
                    full_marker = actual_marker_tag if actual_marker_tag.startswith("\\") else f"\\{actual_marker_tag}"
                    # ... counting ...
This prioritizes token.marker. For most standard USFM markers (\p, \v, \c, \s1, \q1, \f, \xt, etc.), token.marker should correctly give the marker tag (e.g., "p", "v", "c", "s1", "q1", "f", "xt").
The fallback to token.text (excluding BOOK type) is a safeguard.
The addition of \\ if not present is good.
Potential Issue: If sil-machine's UsfmTokenizer for some obscure or custom markers puts the critical identifying part in token.data and token.marker is generic (e.g., token.marker is "fig" but token.data specifies attributes like src or alt), your current logic would just count \fig. This is generally the desired behavior for counting marker occurrences, but if you ever needed to distinguish based on attributes, this would be a limitation. For simple marker counting, it's fine.
Character Markers: Markers like \wj ... \wj* are often tokenized such that \wj is a UsfmToken with type = UsfmTokenType.CHARACTER and marker = "wj". The closing \wj* would be an END token with marker = "wj". Your current logic counts the opening \wj correctly. It doesn't explicitly count end markers, which is usually intended.
Context for currently_in_verse_text_block:

The logic for setting currently_in_verse_text_block is:
python
            if token.type == UsfmTokenType.VERSE:
                currently_in_verse_text_block = True
            elif token.type in [
                UsfmTokenType.BOOK,
                UsfmTokenType.CHAPTER,
                UsfmTokenType.PARAGRAPH, # Covers \p, \s, \q, \d, \mt, \imt, \nb, etc.
                UsfmTokenType.NOTE       # Covers \f, \x, \fe, etc.
            ]:
                currently_in_verse_text_block = False
This means text immediately following a \p (paragraph marker) would have currently_in_verse_text_block = False until the next \v is hit. This is a strict interpretation of "verse text."
Potential Counting Impact: If a translation places a paragraph marker \p after a verse marker \v 1 but before the actual text of verse 1, like \v 1 \p In the beginning..., then "In the beginning" would not be counted because the \p (a PARAGRAPH token) would set currently_in_verse_text_block to False.
Standard USFM practice is usually \p \v 1 In the beginning... or \q1 \v 1 .... If the \p or \q comes first, currently_in_verse_text_block would be False. Then \v sets it to True, and the subsequent TEXT token is correctly processed.
The issue arises if the order is \v \p TEXT.
A more robust approach for "verse text context" might be to consider text as "verse text" if it follows a \v and no intervening "strong" structural marker (like \c, \id, or perhaps some types of notes that fully interrupt verse flow) has occurred. Paragraph markers (\p, \q, etc.) are usually part of the verse content flow.
Let's refine the currently_in_verse_text_block logic to be more permissive for paragraph markers that are typically part of verse content.

                ]:
                    currently_in_verse_text_block = False


Explanation of the Diff and Further Considerations:

Redundant PunctuationByBook Removed (Line 167):

Corrected the duplicate initialization. The one with the comment {book_id: {char: count}} is the one used for the summary's "TopNCommonPunctuation", so it's kept.
Refined currently_in_verse_text_block Logic (Lines 283-294):

The key change is that UsfmTokenType.PARAGRAPH (which covers \p, \q, \s, \mt, \imt, \nb, etc.) no longer unconditionally sets currently_in_verse_text_block to False.
New Behavior:
UsfmTokenType.VERSE sets it to True.
UsfmTokenType.BOOK, UsfmTokenType.CHAPTER, and UsfmTokenType.NOTE will set it to False. This means text within notes (\f ... \f*, \x ... \x*) will not be counted as verse words/punctuation.
If currently_in_verse_text_block is already True (because a \v was encountered), and then a \p or \q token appears, the flag remains True. The text following that \p or \q (if it's a TEXT token) will still be considered part of the verse text block.
This revised logic should better handle cases like \v 1 \p Text of verse one. or \p \v 1 Text of verse one. by ensuring the "Text of verse one" is captured.
Section headings (\s, \s1, etc.) are typically UsfmTokenType.PARAGRAPH. If they appear before any \v in a chapter, currently_in_verse_text_block would be False, so their text content wouldn't be counted as words/punctuation for the verse stats, which is generally desirable. If they appear mid-chapter after some verses, they would also not reset the currently_in_verse_text_block flag if it was already true from a preceding \v, but the text within the \s marker itself is not a TEXT token immediately following a \v in the same way verse content is. The TEXT tokens that form the heading content would be processed, but the currently_in_verse_text_block flag's state depends on the preceding \v. This might need further thought if you want to strictly exclude heading text even if it appears after a verse marker without an intervening chapter marker. However, the current change is a good step towards capturing more legitimate verse text.
Other Minor Points (No Code Change, Just Observation):

is_word_char and Numbers: You excluded 'Nd' (decimal digits). If you find that other number categories (like 'No' - Number, Other, e.g., circled numbers, or 'Nl' - Number, Letter, e.g., Roman numerals) are appearing as "words" and you want to exclude them, you'd expand the check in is_word_char. For now, excluding 'Nd' is a good start.
Script Detection Sample: The script detection sample is collected from text that passes the currently_in_verse_text_block check. This is good, as it focuses the script detection on the primary textual content.
After applying the diff (primarily the PunctuationByBook cleanup and the refined currently_in_verse_text_block logic), it would be good to test again, paying attention to:

Projects where you suspected words/punctuation might have been missed due to \p or \q markers potentially resetting the context too aggressively.
The "shortest words" list to see if it's cleaner and if the "odd" words you mentioned previously are now gone (if they were indeed from non-verse contexts like notes or headings).
This iterative refinement is key to robust text analysis!

I would like to add an env variable, to assist with testing PROCESS_N_PROJECTS=1 #or a small number. The initial scan of folders can proceed as usual to filter the projects to be considered. Then once the N projects have been processed the code would exit.

I have in mind also that it would be useful to consider multithreading (perhaps using the mp module) or other system. This is for later, but if that is implemented later then this value could either be applied on a per-thread basis, or would override the multithreading approach for those runs.


Gemini
That's a handy feature for testing! Limiting the number of projects processed can significantly speed up your development and debugging cycles.

Here's how we can integrate the PROCESS_N_PROJECTS environment variable into your project_analyser.py script:

Read from .env: We'll read the PROCESS_N_PROJECTS variable.
Apply the Limit: In the main loop that iterates through project_paths, we'll keep a counter and break out of the loop once PROCESS_N_PROJECTS have been processed.
Regarding multithreading for later: This approach of limiting projects is perfectly compatible. If you introduce multithreading, you could either:

Have this limit apply to the total number of projects submitted to the thread pool.
Or, if each thread were to pick projects from a queue, this limit might be less directly applicable unless you pre-filter the queue. For now, we'll implement it as a simple global limit on the main processing loop.

Explanation of Changes:

Read PROCESS_N_PROJECTS from .env (Line 491):

process_n_projects_env = os.getenv("PROCESS_N_PROJECTS") is added.
Add Command-Line Argument --process_n_projects (Lines 517-520):

A new argument --process_n_projects is added, allowing the user to override the .env value from the command line.
Determine limit_n_projects (Lines 540-547):

The script now determines the actual limit:
It prioritizes the command-line argument (args.process_n_projects).
If that's not provided, it tries to use the value from the .env file (process_n_projects_env), converting it to an integer.
Includes a try-except block to handle cases where PROCESS_N_PROJECTS in the .env file might not be a valid integer, printing a warning and defaulting to processing all projects in such cases.
Implement the Processing Limit in the Loop (Lines 549-552, 573):

projects_processed_count = 0 is initialized before the loop.
At the beginning of the for proj_path in project_paths: loop, it checks:
python
if limit_n_projects is not None and projects_processed_count >= limit_n_projects:
    print(f"Reached processing limit of {limit_n_projects} projects.")
    break
If the limit is set and has been reached, it prints a message and breaks out of the loop.
projects_processed_count += 1 is added at the end of the loop (after a project has been processed and its data appended) to increment the counter.
How to Use:

Set in .env file:

properties
# .env
PROJECTS_FOLDER=M:\Paratext\projects
OUTPUT_FOLDER=F:\Corpora\projects_summary
DETAILS_OUTPUT_FOLDER=F:\Corpora\projects_summary\projects_details
PROCESS_N_PROJECTS=2 
Running python project_analyser.py will process only the first 2 projects found.

Override with Command-Line Argument: python project_analyser.py --process_n_projects 1 This will process only 1 project, even if PROCESS_N_PROJECTS in .env is different or not set.

Process All:

If PROCESS_N_PROJECTS is commented out or not present in .env and --process_n_projects is not used, all found projects will be processed.
If PROCESS_N_PROJECTS is set to an invalid value (e.g., "abc") in .env, it will print a warning and process all.
This should give you the control you need for efficient testing!

At the moment, if I understand correctly, the code is storing data for the final project_analysis_summary.xlsx file. Could the data that is being stored also saved in the per-project details.xlsx files, then at the end those could be collated into the summary file. Is that a good approach - for reducing memory use, providing better restartability and potentially preparing for a multi-threaded approach?


Gemini
That's a very insightful question, and yes, your proposed approach is an excellent strategy for several reasons!

Storing the aggregated summary-level data within each per-project _details.xlsx file, and then collating these into the final project_analysis_summary.xlsx at the end, offers significant advantages:

Reduced Memory Usage: The main script (project_analyser.py) would no longer need to keep all project analysis results (all_project_analysis_results) in memory simultaneously. It would process one project, save its detailed report (now including its own summary data), and then could discard that project's data from memory before moving to the next. This is especially beneficial when analyzing hundreds or thousands of projects.
Enhanced Restartability/Resumability:
If the main script is interrupted, you've already processed and saved complete data (including summary aggregates) for several projects.
When restarting, the script can identify already processed projects (by checking for their _details.xlsx files) and skip re-analyzing them (unless --force is used).
The final collation step would then simply read the summary data from all existing _details.xlsx files, whether they were generated in the current run or a previous one.
Better Preparation for Multithreading/Multiprocessing:
Each thread/process could independently analyze a project and write its complete _details.xlsx file (with its summary data).
There would be no need for complex inter-process communication or locking to update a shared in-memory list of results.
The final collation step would remain a single-threaded operation at the end, reading all the generated detailed files.
Data Integrity: Each _details.xlsx file becomes a self-contained record of that project's analysis, including the specific aggregates that would contribute to the master summary.
How to Implement This Approach:

The main changes would involve:

analyze_project_data function: This function will remain largely the same, as it already calculates all the necessary details for one project.
generate_detailed_project_report function:
This function will now be responsible for calculating the summary-level aggregates for the single project it is processing.
It will add a new sheet to the _details.xlsx file, perhaps named "Project_Summary_Data", which will store these aggregates (e.g., TotalUniqueSFMMarkers_Summary, TopNCommonPunctuation, shortest/longest words for that specific project).
generate_master_summary_report function:
This function will change significantly. Instead of receiving all_projects_data (a list of dictionaries), it will:
Scan the output folder(s) for all _details.xlsx files.
For each _details.xlsx file found, it will read the "Project_Summary_Data" sheet (and perhaps some key metadata from the "Project_Metadata" sheet).
It will then compile these individual project summaries into the final project_analysis_summary.xlsx.
main function:
Will no longer accumulate all_project_analysis_results.
After processing all projects (or the limited number), it will call generate_master_summary_report which will then do the collation.
Let's outline the changes with a diff. This will be a more substantial refactoring, particularly for generate_master_summary_report and how main handles the flow.

Key Changes and Explanations:

generate_detailed_project_report (Function Modified):

Calculate Project Aggregates: Before writing to Excel, it now calculates the summary-level aggregates (total unique SFM markers, top N common, total punctuation, shortest/longest words) for the current project only. These are stored in project_summary_aggregates.
New Sheet "Project_Summary_Data": A new sheet is added to the _details.xlsx file. This sheet contains a single row with all the metadata (from the "Project_Metadata" sheet) plus these newly calculated project_summary_aggregates. Keys for aggregates are suffixed with _Project (e.g., TotalUniqueSFMMarkers_Project).
The "Word_Extremes" sheet name is changed to "Word_Extremes_Project" for clarity.
Returns True on successful report generation, False on failure.
collate_master_summary_report (New Function, Replaces generate_master_summary_report):

This function is responsible for creating the final project_analysis_summary.xlsx.
It determines the folder where detailed reports are stored (details_output_folder_override if provided, otherwise main_output_folder).
It scans this folder for all *_details.xlsx files.
For each detailed file found:
It reads the "Project_Summary_Data" sheet.
It takes the (single row of) data from this sheet.
It renames keys ending with _Project to end with _Summary for the master report.
It adds the PathToDetailedReport.
This dictionary is appended to a list (summary_list).
Includes error handling for missing or unreadable detailed files/sheets.
Finally, it creates the project_analysis_summary.xlsx and .csv from summary_list, similar to before, but using main_output_folder for saving these.
SFM Exclusion List for Master Summary: The sfm_exclude_list is passed to this function. However, the current implementation uses the TopNCommonSFMMarkers_Project directly from the detailed file. If you need the TopNCommonSFMMarkers_Summary in the master report to strictly adhere to the sfm_exclude_list at the time of collation, this function would need to re-read the "SFM_Markers_By_Book" sheet from each detailed file, re-calculate the sfm_summary_counter applying the exclusion, and then generate the TopN..._Summary string. For now, it uses the project-level TopN. This is a point for potential refinement if strict exclusion at the master summary level for TopN is critical. The total counts (TotalUniqueSFMMarkers_Summary, TotalSFMMarkerInstances_Summary) would still need to be recalculated here if an exclusion list is applied. The provided diff simplifies this by directly using the aggregates from the detail file, which means the sfm_exclude_list currently only affects the TopN... string if it were recalculated during collation.
main Function (Modified):

No longer maintains all_project_analysis_results.
After the loop processing individual projects, it calls collate_master_summary_report instead of generate_master_summary_report.
The projects_processed_count now increments only if generate_detailed_project_report returns True.
To Make the SFM Exclusion List Fully Effective for Master Summary Aggregates:

If you want the sfm_exclude_list to affect the TotalUniqueSFMMarkers_Summary, TotalSFMMarkerInstances_Summary, and TopNCommonSFMMarkers_Summary in the master report, the collate_master_summary_report function would need to:

Instead of just taking project_entry['TotalUniqueSFMMarkers_Project'], etc.:

Read the "SFM_Markers_By_Book" sheet from detail_file_path.
Reconstruct the project-wide sfm_summary_counter for that project.
Apply the sfm_exclude_list to this counter.
Then calculate TotalUniqueSFMMarkers_Summary, TotalSFMMarkerInstances_Summary, and TopNCommonSFMMarkers_Summary based on the filtered counter for that project's entry in the master summary.
This adds a bit more processing during collation but ensures the master summary accurately reflects exclusions. The current diff takes a simpler approach by reusing the aggregates already calculated for the detailed file's "Project_Summary_Data" sheet (which don't have the sfm_exclude_list applied).

This refactoring is a significant step towards a more robust and scalable architecture. It's a very good direction!

I would also like to implement a --book_filter argument. This could be passed a list of Book ids GEN PSA PRO RUT DAN MAT ROM HEB REV for example. These would then be the only books processed by the code. Those are likely sufficient for finding good test projects. I'm not sure whether lists can be passed as env variables. If they can I'd like to know how to specifiy these in the .env file too.

That's a very useful addition for focusing your analysis! Implementing a --book_filter will allow you to target specific books, which can be great for testing or when you're interested in particular sections of scripture.

Here's how we can add this functionality:

Command-Line Argument: Add a --book_filter argument that accepts a comma-separated list of book IDs.
Environment Variable: While environment variables can store lists (typically as comma-separated strings), it's often cleaner to handle the parsing in your script. We'll read a BOOK_FILTER environment variable and parse it if present. The command-line argument will take precedence.
Filtering Logic:
The list of book IDs to process will be determined.
In analyze_project_data:
When a UsfmTokenType.BOOK token is encountered, if its book ID is not in the filter list (and the filter list is active), that book (and its subsequent tokens in that file) will be skipped for counting purposes.
The TotalBooksProcessed will only count books that are in the filter.
The detailed reports will only contain data for the filtered books.
Let's get to the code changes.

Key Changes and Explanations:

analyze_project_data Function Signature (Line 161):

Book Filtering Logic in analyze_project_data (Lines 275-282):

After a book_code_candidate is identified and checked against BOOK_ORDER:
python
                if book_filter_list and book_code_candidate not in book_filter_list:

                    currently_in_verse_text_block = False # Reset context
                    continue
If book_filter_list is provided (i.e., not None) and the book_code_candidate is not in this list, an info message is printed.
current_book_id_for_file is set to None to ensure no data from this book is counted under its ID.
currently_in_verse_text_block is set to False to prevent text from this filtered-out book from being processed for words/punctuation even if a \v marker was in its header.
continue is used to skip to the next token. This effectively ignores all content of the filtered-out book for counting purposes.
Environment Variable and Argument Parsing in main():

Read BOOK_FILTER from .env (Line 580): book_filter_env = os.getenv("BOOK_FILTER")
Add --book_filter Command-Line Argument (Lines 609-612): Allows users to specify a comma-separated list of book IDs.
Determine active_book_filter (Lines 639-643):
The command-line argument --book_filter takes precedence.
If not provided, the BOOK_FILTER from .env is used.
The string is split by commas, each part is stripped of whitespace and converted to uppercase, and then stored in a set for efficient lookup. An empty string after stripping results in it not being added to the set.
If neither is provided, active_book_filter remains None.
Pass active_book_filter to analyze_project_data (Line 661): current_project_data = analyze_project_data(proj_path, args.n_words, active_book_filter)
PROCESS_N_PROJECTS Handling (Line 635):

Added a small refinement: if limit_n_projects <= 0: limit_n_projects = None. This ensures that if PROCESS_N_PROJECTS is set to 0 or a negative number, it's treated as no limit (i.e., process all).
How to Specify Book Filters:

Via .env file: Add a line like this to your .env file:

properties
BOOK_FILTER=GEN,PSA,MAT,ROM
or

properties
BOOK_FILTER=GEN, PSA, MAT, ROM 
(Spaces around commas will be handled by strip()).

Via Command Line:

bash
python project_analyser.py --book_filter "GEN,PSA,MAT,ROM"
or

bash
python project_analyser.py --book_filter GEN,PSA,JHN
(Quotes are generally good practice if your shell might interpret commas specially, but often not strictly necessary for simple comma-separated lists without spaces).

Impact of the Filter:

TotalBooksProcessed: Will only reflect the count of unique book IDs that were processed and were part of the filter (and BOOK_ORDER).
Detailed Report Sheets (SFM_Markers_By_Book, Punctuation_By_Book): Will only contain columns for the books that passed the filter.
Word/Punctuation Counts: Will only be derived from the text of the filtered books.
Script Detection Sample: Will also only be collected from the filtered books.
This provides a flexible way to narrow down the scope of your analysis, which is excellent for targeted investigations or faster test runs!

I have included a copy of canon.py from machine.py/machine/scripture/canon.py Can we use that to import and use ALL_BOOK_IDS for the possible book names. Let's also import NON_CANONICAL_IDS as I would like the code to support those too. If other functions there can be used, let's refactor the code to make use of them where that makes sense to do.


Gemini
It's a great idea to leverage the canon.py module from sil-machine! It provides a standardized and more comprehensive way to handle book IDs and their properties. This will make your project_analyser.py script more robust and aligned with sil-machine's conventions.

Here's how we can refactor project_analyser.py to use canon.py:

Import from canon.py: We'll import ALL_BOOK_IDS and is_canonical (and potentially book_id_to_number if needed, though is_canonical might suffice for filtering). We won't directly use NON_CANONICAL_IDS for filtering if is_canonical already serves that purpose, but ALL_BOOK_IDS will replace your manually defined BOOK_ORDER.
Replace BOOK_ORDER: Your BOOK_ORDER list will be replaced by ALL_BOOK_IDS from canon.py. This ensures you're using the same comprehensive list as sil-machine.
Update Book Filtering Logic: The logic that checks if a book is "canonical" or should be skipped will be updated to use is_canonical(book_code_candidate). The book_filter_list (from command-line/env) will still be applied after this check.

Explanation of Changes:

Imports (Lines 24, 37-38, 61):

Removed book_id_to_number from the machine.scripture import as canon.py provides its own version (which we also import as book_id_to_number for potential use, though is_canonical is primary for filtering here).
Added from machine.scripture.canon import ALL_BOOK_IDS as CANON_ALL_BOOK_IDS, is_canonical, book_id_to_number.
ALL_BOOK_IDS is imported as CANON_ALL_BOOK_IDS to avoid a name collision if you had another ALL_BOOK_IDS variable locally (though you didn't in this case, it's good practice for clarity when importing globals).
is_canonical is imported for checking if a book ID is considered canonical by sil-machine.
BOOK_ORDER = CANON_ALL_BOOK_IDS: Your local BOOK_ORDER list is now directly assigned from the comprehensive list in canon.py. This will be used for sorting book columns in your Excel output, ensuring a standard order.
Book Filtering Logic in analyze_project_data (Lines 275-278):

The line if book_code_candidate not in BOOK_ORDER: is changed to: if not is_canonical(book_code_candidate):
This now uses the is_canonical() function from canon.py to determine if a book should be processed. The is_canonical function internally checks against NON_CANONICAL_IDS and also validates the book ID format.
The print message is updated to reflect that the check is now based on canon.py.
The subsequent book_filter_list check (for user-defined filters) remains the same and will apply after a book has been deemed canonical by sil-machine's definition.
Benefits of this Change:

Standardization: You're using the same definition of book IDs and canonicity as the sil-machine library itself, which is excellent for consistency if you or others use sil-machine for other tasks with these projects.
Maintainability: If sil-machine updates its list of recognized book IDs or its definition of canonicity, your script will automatically pick up these changes when you update the sil-machine library, without you needing to manually update your local BOOK_ORDER list.
Comprehensiveness: canon.ALL_BOOK_IDS is likely more exhaustive and curated than a manually maintained list.
Regarding NON_CANONICAL_IDS:

You asked to import NON_CANONICAL_IDS. While we've imported it (implicitly, as is_canonical uses it), we are not directly using the NON_CANONICAL_IDS set in your project_analyser.py code. The is_canonical(book_id) function from canon.py encapsulates the logic of checking against this set. This is generally a cleaner approach, as it relies on the abstraction provided by is_canonical.

If you had a specific need to iterate over NON_CANONICAL_IDS or use it for a different purpose, you could import it explicitly: from machine.scripture.canon import NON_CANONICAL_IDS And then use it. But for the current filtering requirement ("process only canonical books, unless further filtered by user"), is_canonical() is the more direct and appropriate function to use.

This refactoring makes your script more robust and better integrated with the sil-machine ecosystem!

I'd like to debug the part of the code that is reading the Settings.xml files and extracting some data from them. One field "MainScript" is no longer needed as the script information isn't in the Settings.xml file and the DetectedScript code is working well. The line <LanguageIsoCode>pes:::</LanguageIsoCode> is almost always present. I don't know how this data is processed by machine. Either the whole tag (pes::: in this example) or the first part (pes) could be stored in the LanguageTag field - which ever is easiest to obtain, with a preference for the full tag if that is simple.


Gemini
Okay, let's refine the Settings.xml parsing logic in project_analyser.py. It's good to focus on getting the essential and reliably available information.

You're right, "MainScript" can be removed as "DetectedScript" is serving you well. For "LanguageTag", sil-machine's FileParatextProjectSettingsParser typically exposes an attribute like language_tag or languageTag which should contain the content of <LanguageIsoCode>. We'll aim to capture that.

Here are the proposed changes:

Remove "MainScript":
From the project_results dictionary initialization.
From the meta_cols list in generate_detailed_project_report.
From the summary_column_order list in collate_master_summary_report.
Ensure "LanguageTag" is Captured:
The existing project_results["LanguageTag"] = getattr(settings, 'language_tag', 'Unknown') is likely correct if sil-machine uses language_tag as the attribute name for the parsed ISO code. We'll keep this and assume it provides the full tag as preferred. If sil-machine internally splits it, then that's what we'll get.
Refine Warning Messages: Add more specific warnings if essential fields like language_name or language_tag are missing from a successfully parsed settings object.

Key Changes:

project_results Initialization (analyze_project_data):

Removed "MainScript": "Unknown",.
Settings Parsing (analyze_project_data):

project_results["LanguageTag"] = getattr(settings, 'language_tag', 'Unknown') remains the primary way to get the language tag. This relies on sil-machine's FileParatextProjectSettingsParser to correctly parse the <LanguageIsoCode> tag and expose it via a language_tag attribute on the settings object. It will store whatever sil-machine provides (e.g., "pes:::" or "pes").
Added specific warning messages if LanguageName or LanguageTag end up as "Unknown" after attempting to read them from a successfully parsed settings object. This helps pinpoint if those specific fields are missing in Settings.xml.
The previous general warning for language name missing was removed as the new specific warnings cover this better.
meta_cols (generate_detailed_project_report):

LanguageTag was already implicitly included if present in project_results because meta_df_data = {k: [project_results.get(k, "")] for k in meta_cols} would fetch it. I've made sure it's explicitly listed in meta_cols for clarity if it wasn't already, and removed MainScript. (Looking back at your provided code, LanguageTag was already in meta_cols in the Project_Metadata sheet section, which is good). The main change here is removing MainScript.
summary_column_order (collate_master_summary_report):

Removed MainScript.
Ensured LanguageTag is present.
Debugging LanguageTag Further (If Needed):

If LanguageTag is still "Unknown" for projects where you expect it:

Check Settings.xml: Manually inspect the Settings.xml for one of these projects. Confirm the exact spelling and casing of the <LanguageIsoCode> tag and its content.
sil-machine Behavior (Conceptual):
The FileParatextProjectSettingsParser in sil-machine is responsible for reading this XML. If it encounters <LanguageIsoCode>pes:::</LanguageIsoCode>, it should store "pes:::" (or potentially just "pes" if it does its own sub-parsing) in an attribute of the ParatextProjectSettings object it returns. The most common attribute name for this would be language_tag or languageTag.
If sil-machine uses a different attribute name, you'd need to change getattr(settings, 'language_tag', 'Unknown') to use that correct attribute name. Discovering this might involve looking at sil-machine documentation or, if necessary, inspecting the settings object in a debugger for a project where Settings.xml is successfully parsed.
For now, language_tag is a very standard and likely choice.
These changes should clean up the script by removing the unneeded "MainScript" and ensure that "LanguageTag" is being handled as robustly as possible given the reliance on sil-machine's parsing. The more specific warnings should also help if Settings.xml files are missing expected language information.

Can you describe how I can check that the getattr names are the correct ones. getattr(settings, 'language_name' for example?


Gemini
Ah, that's a great question for ensuring your script correctly interfaces with the sil-machine library! When you're using getattr(settings, 'attribute_name', 'DefaultValue'), you're relying on the settings object (which is an instance of ParatextProjectSettings from sil-machine) to have an attribute named exactly 'attribute_name'. If the library uses a slightly different name, getattr will gracefully return your default value, but you won't get the data you expect.

Here are several ways you can check and confirm the correct attribute names for the ParatextProjectSettings object:

Inspect the sil-machine Source Code (Most Reliable):

Navigate to the sil-machine library code within your Python environment's site-packages directory (or wherever it's installed).
Look for the file that defines the ParatextProjectSettings class. This is typically in a path like machine/corpora/paratext_project_settings.py or similar.
Open this file and examine the class definition. You'll see the attributes defined in its __init__ method or as properties. This is the most direct way to see the exact names sil-machine uses.
For example, you might find something like:
python
# In sil-machine's paratext_project_settings.py (example)
class ParatextProjectSettings:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.name: str = ""
        self.full_name: str = "" # <-- This is what you're looking for
        self.language_name: str = "" # <-- And this
        self.language_tag: str = "" # <-- And this
        self.is_right_to_left: bool = False
        # ... and other attributes
Interactive Python Session / Debugger (Practical Inspection):

This is a very effective way to explore an object live.
Modify your project_analyser.py script temporarily. Find a place after settings = settings_parser.parse() and where you're confident settings is not None (i.e., for a project with a valid Settings.xml).
Add the following lines:
python
# In analyze_project_data, after settings = settings_parser.parse()
if settings:
    print(f"--- Debugging settings object for project: {project_name} ---")
    print(f"Type of settings object: {type(settings)}")
    print(f"Attributes of settings object (dir()): {dir(settings)}")

    # Try to print specific attributes you are interested in
    # Use hasattr to avoid errors if they don't exist
    if hasattr(settings, 'full_name'):
        print(f"settings.full_name: {settings.full_name}")
    else:
        print("settings object does NOT have 'full_name'")

    if hasattr(settings, 'language_name'):
        print(f"settings.language_name: {settings.language_name}")
    else:
        print("settings object does NOT have 'language_name'")

    if hasattr(settings, 'language_tag'):
        print(f"settings.language_tag: {settings.language_tag}")
    else:
        print("settings object does NOT have 'language_tag'")

    # You can also try variations if you suspect different casing or names
    if hasattr(settings, 'LanguageName'): # Example of checking a different case
         print(f"settings.LanguageName (different case): {settings.LanguageName}")

    # For a more comprehensive look if you're unsure:
    # for attr_name in dir(settings):
    #     if not attr_name.startswith('_'): # Exclude private/magic methods
    #         try:
    #             attr_value = getattr(settings, attr_name)
    #             print(f"Attribute: {attr_name}, Value: {attr_value}, Type: {type(attr_value)}")
    #         except Exception as e:
    #             print(f"Attribute: {attr_name}, Could not get value: {e}")

    import pdb; pdb.set_trace() # This will drop you into the Python debugger
    # Or, if you prefer, just a sys.exit() here to stop after one project
    # sys.exit(f"Stopped after inspecting settings for {project_name}")
Run your script, perhaps limiting it to process only one project that you know has a Settings.xml.
Using dir(settings): This will list all attributes and methods of the settings object. Look for names that seem relevant (e.g., full_name, language_name, language_tag, is_right_to_left, filename_pre_part, etc.). Python attribute names are typically lowercase with underscores (snake_case).
Using the Debugger (pdb): When the script hits pdb.set_trace(), it will pause, and you'll get a (Pdb) prompt. You can then type:
settings (to see a representation of the object)
settings.full_name (or any other attribute you suspect)
dir(settings)
vars(settings) (often gives a dictionary of instance variables)
Type c (continue) to exit the debugger and let the script finish (or q to quit).
sil-machine Documentation (If Available and Detailed):

Check if the sil-machine library has API documentation that details the ParatextProjectSettings class and its public attributes. Good documentation would explicitly list these.
Example of what you might find and how to adjust:

Let's say after inspecting, you find that sil-machine actually stores the language ISO code in an attribute called iso_code instead of language_tag.

You would then change this line in your project_analyser.py:

python
project_results["LanguageTag"] = getattr(settings, 'language_tag', 'Unknown')
to:

python
project_results["LanguageTag"] = getattr(settings, 'iso_code', 'Unknown')
Current Attribute Names Used in Your Script:

You are currently using getattr for these attributes on the settings object:

is_right_to_left
full_name
language_name
language_tag
filename_pre_part
filename_post_part
filename_form
These are all plausible names. is_right_to_left, language_name, and full_name are very common in Paratext settings objects. language_tag is also a strong candidate for the ISO code. The filename_* attributes are also standard for Paratext project settings.

The interactive/debugger approach (Method 2) is often the quickest way to confirm for a live object if you don't want to immediately dive into the library's source code. Just remember to remove the temporary debugging code afterward!

Let's also remove "ProjectFullName" from the details since the ProjectName is sufficient for that information. I changed language_tag to language_code on line 216, does that need to be updated anywhere else?


Gemini
You're making good progress in refining the data collection! Let's address those two points.

Removing "ProjectFullName": We can remove this from the project_results initialization, the meta_cols in generate_detailed_project_report, and the summary_column_order in collate_master_summary_report. The ProjectName (which is the folder name) is indeed often sufficient.

language_tag to language_code on Line 216: Yes, if you changed project_results["LanguageTag"] = getattr(settings, 'language_tag', 'Unknown') to project_results["LanguageTag"] = getattr(settings, 'language_code', 'Unknown') (assuming line 216 in your local copy corresponds to this), then you should ensure consistency:

The key in the project_results dictionary should ideally reflect what it's storing. If you're now getting the language_code from settings, it might be clearer to store it as project_results["LanguageCode"] rather than reusing the key "LanguageTag".
However, if you decide to keep the key as "LanguageTag" in project_results but fetch it using getattr(settings, 'language_code', ...), that's functionally okay, just a slight mismatch between the key name and the source attribute name.
The important part is that the meta_cols in generate_detailed_project_report and summary_column_order in collate_master_summary_report use the key name that you've decided on for project_results.
For clarity and consistency, if the attribute on the settings object is indeed language_code (and this is what sil-machine provides for the <LanguageIsoCode>), it's best to use "LanguageCode" as the key throughout your script.

Let's assume you've confirmed that settings.language_code is the correct attribute from sil-machine for the ISO code, and you want to use the key "LanguageCode" in your reports.

Here's the diff reflecting the removal of "ProjectFullName" and the consistent use of "LanguageCode" (assuming the change from language_tag to language_code for the getattr call was indeed made on your line 216).

Summary of Changes:

project_results Initialization (Line 168):

Removed "ProjectFullName": "Unknown",.
Changed "LanguageTag": "Unknown", to "LanguageCode": "Unknown",.
Settings Parsing in analyze_project_data (Lines 200-208):

Removed the line that set project_results["ProjectFullName"].
Changed project_results["LanguageTag"] = getattr(settings, 'language_code', 'Unknown') to project_results["LanguageCode"] = getattr(settings, 'language_code', 'Unknown').
Updated the warning message to refer to "LanguageCode".
meta_cols in generate_detailed_project_report (Line 443):

Removed "ProjectFullName".
Changed "LanguageTag" to "LanguageCode".
summary_column_order in collate_master_summary_report (Line 565):

Removed "ProjectFullName".
Changed "LanguageTag" to "LanguageCode".
This ensures that "ProjectFullName" is no longer collected or reported, and if you've indeed found that settings.language_code is the correct attribute for the ISO code from sil-machine, then using "LanguageCode" as the key throughout your script and reports will provide better clarity and consistency.

If sil-machine actually uses settings.language_tag for the ISO code, then you'd revert the LanguageCode changes back to LanguageTag but still keep the "ProjectFullName" removal. The key is to match what getattr(settings, 'ACTUAL_ATTRIBUTE_NAME_FROM_SIL_MACHINE', ...) is fetching.

Let's speed up processing when PROCESS_N_PROJECTS is set - in that case when we scan directories at the beginning, could we note projects that have the required books if BOOK_FILTER is set. Otherwise, when BOOK_FILTER isn't set just count projects. Once N projects have been found let's stop scanning (often hundreds of other projects) and process those found.

That's a clever optimization for testing! If you're limiting the number of projects to process and you have a book filter, it makes sense to stop scanning for projects once you've found enough candidates that actually contain the books you're interested in.

Here's how we can modify the get_project_paths function to implement this:

Pass limit_n_projects and active_book_filter to get_project_paths: The main function will pass these values to get_project_paths.
Early Exit from Directory Scan:
Inside get_project_paths, when iterating through directories with tqdm, if limit_n_projects is set:
If active_book_filter is also set, we'll need to do a quick check within each potential project folder to see if it contains at least one of the filtered books. This involves looking for USFM files named appropriately (e.g., 01GEN*.sfm, 40MAT*.sfm). If it does, we count it as a "qualifying" project.
If active_book_filter is not set, any valid Paratext project folder counts.
Once limit_n_projects qualifying projects are found by this initial scan, we can break out of the tqdm loop.
Process Only Found Candidates: The rest of the get_project_paths logic (handling dated versions) will then operate only on this potentially smaller list of candidate_paths.
This will require a new helper function to quickly check for the presence of filtered book files within a project directory.

Explanation of Changes:

project_contains_filtered_books Helper Function (New, Lines 102-119):

Takes a project_path (Path object) and the book_filter_list (set of uppercase book IDs).
If book_filter_list is empty/None, it returns True (no filter means the project "qualifies").
Iterates through the book_filter_list. For each book_id_filter:
It gets the book_num using book_id_to_number from canon.py.
It constructs a search_pattern_prefix like "01GEN", "40MAT" (book number padded to two digits, followed by the book ID).
It checks if any file in the project_path starts with this prefix (case-insensitive for the prefix part of the filename) and has a .sfm or .usfm suffix.
If a match is found, the project contains at least one of the desired books, so it returns True.
If the loop completes without finding any matches, it returns False.
get_project_paths Function Modified (Lines 121-157):

New Parameters: Added limit_n_projects_to_scan=None and active_book_filter_for_scan=None.
Early Exit Logic:
qualifying_projects_found_count is initialized.
The tqdm description is changed to "Scanning for project folders".
Inside the loop, after is_paratext_project_folder confirms a valid project:
If limit_n_projects_to_scan is active:
If active_book_filter_for_scan is also active, it calls project_contains_filtered_books. Only if this returns True is the project added to candidate_paths and qualifying_projects_found_count incremented.
If active_book_filter_for_scan is not active, any valid project is a "qualifying" project.
After potentially adding a project, it checks if qualifying_projects_found_count >= limit_n_projects_to_scan. If so, it prints a message and breaks from the os.listdir loop.
If limit_n_projects_to_scan is not active, all valid projects are added to candidate_paths as before.
The rest of the function (handling dated versions) remains the same but now operates on the potentially pre-filtered candidate_paths.
main Function Modified:

Determine limit_n_projects (Lines 660-667): This logic (which determines the number of projects to actually process fully) remains. This limit_n_projects will be passed as limit_n_projects_to_scan to get_project_paths.
Determine active_book_filter (Lines 669-672): This also remains. This active_book_filter will be passed as active_book_filter_for_scan to get_project_paths.
Call to get_project_paths (Line 668, moved after limit/filter determination): project_paths = get_project_paths(args.projects_folder, limit_n_projects, active_book_filter) Now, get_project_paths receives the processing limit and the book filter, allowing it to potentially stop its own scanning early.
How it Works Now:

If PROCESS_N_PROJECTS (or --process_n_projects) is set, get_project_paths will try to find that many qualifying projects and then stop scanning further directories.
If BOOK_FILTER (or --book_filter) is also set, a "qualifying" project is one that is a valid Paratext project and contains at least one of the specified books (based on filename checks).
If no book filter is set, any valid Paratext project is "qualifying".
The get_project_paths function then proceeds to select the latest versions from the candidates it found (which might be fewer than all possible projects if the scan stopped early).
The main processing loop in main will then iterate over this project_paths list. The limit_n_projects check within this loop ensures that even if get_project_paths returned more projects than the limit (e.g., due to multiple dated versions of the same qualifying base project), only the specified number are fully analyzed.
This should significantly speed up test runs when you're using PROCESS_N_PROJECTS and especially when combined with BOOK_FILTER, as it avoids unnecessary directory traversals and initial checks.

It looks like there's a small issue with the order of operations in the main() function. The project_paths variable is being used before it's assigned when the limit_n_projects and active_book_filter are determined after the initial print(f"Scanning for projects in: {args.projects_folder}") and the if not project_paths: check.

We need to ensure that active_book_filter and limit_n_projects are determined before get_project_paths is called and before any checks on project_paths are made.

Here's the corrected order within the main() function:

+    projects_processed_count = 0
 
     for proj_path in project_paths:
         if limit_n_projects is not None and projects_processed_count >= limit_n_projects:

Explanation of the Change:

Order of Operations in main():
The determination of limit_n_projects (Lines 729-736 in the new code) and active_book_filter (Lines 738-741) is now done before the call to get_project_paths.
The print(f"Scanning for projects in: {args.projects_folder}") line is moved to just before get_project_paths is called.
The check if not project_paths: and the subsequent print statement are now correctly placed after project_paths has been assigned by the call to get_project_paths.
The message for "No Paratext projects found" is slightly updated to acknowledge that filters might also lead to an empty list.
The message print(f"Found {len(project_paths)} potential projects.") is changed to print(f"Selected {len(project_paths)} project(s) after date filtering and initial scan limits.") to more accurately reflect what project_paths contains at that stage.
This reordering ensures that all necessary variables (limit_n_projects, active_book_filter) are defined before get_project_paths needs them, and project_paths itself is defined before it's checked or used. This should resolve the UnboundLocalError.

I notice that the process of Skipping books that are filtered out seems very slow. I would have expected that a list of SFM filenames could be filtered to those of interest nearly instantly. However the code seems to print the Skipping book '{book_code_candidate}' found in {usfm_file_path.name} (not in book_filter_list) message at a rate of about one book per second.
Can you see a way to speed up that filtering process?


Gemini
You've correctly identified a significant performance bottleneck! Reading and tokenizing entire USFM files just to discover that the book within isn't in your filter is indeed inefficient, especially when dealing with many files.

The strategy to pre-filter the list of USFM files based on their filenames is an excellent way to optimize this. Paratext projects often (though not universally) use filenames that include the book number and a 3-letter book ID (e.g., 01GENxyz.SFM, 40MATpdq.usfm). We can leverage this convention.

Here's how we can implement this optimization:

New Helper Function extract_book_id_from_filename(filename_str): This function will attempt to parse a book ID from a given filename string using a regular expression.
Pre-filtering in analyze_project_data:
After the initial gathering of all *.SFM and *.usfm files into the usfm_files list.
If book_filter_list is active, we will iterate through this usfm_files list.
For each file, we'll use extract_book_id_from_filename to guess the book ID.
If a book ID is successfully extracted from the filename:
We check if this guessed ID is canonical using is_canonical().
We then check if this canonical ID is in the user's book_filter_list.
If it's not canonical or not in the filter, the file is skipped early, and a message is printed.
Files for which a book ID cannot be extracted from the filename, or files whose filename-extracted ID is in the filter, will be kept for full processing (read, tokenize, and then confirm the book ID from the \id marker).
This results in a potentially much smaller list of files to iterate through for full parsing.

Explanation of Changes:

FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN and extract_book_id_from_filename (New, Lines 186-197):

A regular expression FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN is defined to capture common Paratext filename structures that include book numbers and IDs (e.g., 01GEN..., A40MAT...). It specifically looks for a sequence that often starts with 2 or 3 digits (book number, though not captured directly by this regex for the ID part) followed by three characters that are typically uppercase letters or digits 1-3 (for books like 1SA, 2PE, 3JN). The (?:[A-Z0-9]{0,3})? part allows for an optional prefix like "A" or "PTN" before the number. The key part is ([1-3A-Z]{3}) which captures the 3-character book ID.
The extract_book_id_from_filename function uses this regex. If a match is found, it extracts the potential 3-character book ID (group 1 of the regex), converts it to uppercase, and then uses book_id_to_number() from your canon.py to validate if it's a recognized book ID format. This helps filter out false positives from the regex.
Pre-filtering Logic in analyze_project_data (Lines 300-319):

After usfm_files is populated with all found USFM files in the project.
A new list files_to_process_fully is created.
If book_filter_list is active and there are usfm_files:
It iterates through the original usfm_files.
extract_book_id_from_filename is called for each file.
If filename_book_id is extracted:
It first checks if this filename_book_id is canonical using is_canonical(). If it's not (e.g., "XYZ" from "00XYZ.sfm"), it's added to files_to_process_fully because the filename might be misleading, and we need to check the \id tag. A message is printed.
If it is canonical but not in the book_filter_list, the file is skipped entirely (continue), and an informative message is printed. This is where the main speedup occurs.
If it is canonical and is in the book_filter_list (or if the filter is not active), the file is added to files_to_process_fully.
If filename_book_id cannot be extracted: The file is added to files_to_process_fully because we must open and parse it to determine its actual book ID from the \id tag.
If book_filter_list is not active, files_to_process_fully simply becomes a copy of usfm_files.
The main processing loop for usfm_file_path in ...: now iterates over files_to_process_fully.
Internal \id Tag Check Remains: The existing logic inside the loop that reads the \id tag and then checks book_code_candidate against is_canonical and book_filter_list is still essential. This acts as the definitive check, especially for files where the book ID couldn't be guessed from the filename or where the filename guess might have been ambiguous.

Expected Outcome:

When you run the script with a --book_filter (and PROCESS_N_PROJECTS for testing):

You should see "Pre-filtering..." messages for projects being analyzed.
For files whose names clearly indicate a book ID that's not in your filter, you'll see "Skipping file..." messages, and these files will not be opened or tokenized. This should be very fast.
Files whose names suggest they are in the filter, or whose book ID cannot be determined from the filename, will proceed to full processing. The "Skipping book..." messages (from inside the token loop) will then only appear for these files if their internal \id tag reveals they are not actually desired.
This two-stage filtering (quick filename-based pre-filter, then definitive \id-tag based filter) should significantly improve performance when a book_filter is active by reducing I/O and tokenization overhead.

You've told me before, but how do i remove the error: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'type' and 'NoneType'


Gemini
That TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'type' and 'NoneType' usually pops up when you're trying to use the | operator (often for combining type hints or for set unions) and one of the operands is None when it's expected to be a type or another compatible object.

Given the context of your project_analyser.py script, the most likely place this would occur is if you're using the newer type hinting syntax like str | None (introduced in Python 3.10) but you're running the script with an older Python version (like Python 3.9 or earlier).

Here's how to address it:

Check Your Python Version: First, confirm the Python version you are using to run the script:

bash
python --version
or

bash
python3 --version
If Using Python < 3.10 (Most Likely Cause): The | operator for type hints is a feature of Python 3.10+. If you're on an older version, you need to use the Union type from the typing module.

Import Union: Add this to the top of your script:
python
from typing import Union
Replace | with Union: Find any type hints that look like SomeType | None and change them to Union[SomeType, None].
For example, in your extract_book_id_from_filename function, the return type hint is str | None:

python
# f:\GitHub\davidbaines\project_analyser\project_analyser\project_analyser.py
def extract_book_id_from_filename(filename_str: str) -> str | None:
    """Attempts to extract a 3-letter book ID from a filename string."""
    # ...
You would change this to:

python
# f:\GitHub\davidbaines\project_analyser\project_analyser\project_analyser.py
from typing import Union # Make sure this import is present at the top

def extract_book_id_from_filename(filename_str: str) -> Union[str, None]:
    """Attempts to extract a 3-letter book ID from a filename string."""
    # ...
Here's the diff for that specific change:

project_analyser.py
import pandas as pd
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union # For older Python type hinting from tqdm import tqdm import machine.corpora try: @@ -201,7 +202,7 @@

It allows for an optional prefix before the number (like 'A' in some archives).
-def extract_book_id_from_filename(filename_str: str) -> str | None: +def extract_book_id_from_filename(filename_str: str) -> Union[str, None]: """Attempts to extract a 3-letter book ID from a filename string.""" match = FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN.match(filename_str) if match:

plaintext
```
You'll need to do this for any other instances of the `|` type hint operator in your script if you're using Python < 3.10.
If Using Python >= 3.10: If you are using Python 3.10 or newer, then the | operator for type hints should be fine. The error might be occurring in a different part of the code where | is used for a different purpose (like a bitwise OR or set union) and one of the operands is unexpectedly None.
Look at the full traceback of the error. It will point to the exact line number where the TypeError occurs.
Examine that line. If it's not a type hint, check the variables involved. One of them is likely None when the operation expects something else (e.g., an integer for bitwise OR, or a set for set union). You'll need to debug why that variable is None at that point.
Given that the example you pointed to (str | None) is a type hint, the Python version is the most probable culprit. Updating the type hint syntax to use Union from the typing module is the standard way to ensure compatibility with older Python versions that don't support the | operator for types.

We added in code to use the filename for filtering projects. I wasn't able to apply that with a single click. I'm not sure that I have included that code correctly. The Skipping is still slow and doesn't seem to happen all at once.


Gemini
You're right to be concerned if the "Skipping file..." messages (from the filename pre-filter) aren't appearing quickly or all at once at the beginning of a project's analysis. That pre-filtering step is designed to be fast. If it's slow, or if the "Skipping book..." messages (from inside the tokenization loop) are still appearing frequently for books that should have been caught by the filename pre-filter, then there's likely an issue in how the pre-filtering is being applied or in the logic of extract_book_id_from_filename.

Let's review the relevant sections in f:\GitHub\davidbaines\project_analyser\project_analyser\project_analyser.py and see if we can spot the issue and refine it.

The current pre-filtering logic is:

python
# f:\GitHub\davidbaines\project_analyser\project_analyser\project_analyser.py
# ...
        # Pre-filter USFM files based on filename if a book_filter_list is active

            print(f"Pre-filtering {len(usfm_files)} USFM files for project {project_name} based on filenames and book filter...")
            for usfm_file_path_candidate in usfm_files:
                filename_book_id = extract_book_id_from_filename(usfm_file_path_candidate.name)
                if filename_book_id:
                    if not is_canonical(filename_book_id):
                        print(f"Info: File '{usfm_file_path_candidate.name}' appears non-canonical by filename ('{filename_book_id}'). Skipping pre-filter for this file (will check \id if processed).")
                        files_to_process_fully.append(usfm_file_path_candidate) # Process to be sure
                    elif filename_book_id not in book_filter_list:
                        print(f"Info: Skipping file '{usfm_file_path_candidate.name}' (book '{filename_book_id}' from filename not in book_filter_list).")
                        continue # Skip this file entirely

                        files_to_process_fully.append(usfm_file_path_candidate) # Likely in filter, process fully
                else:
                    # Cannot determine book from filename, must process fully to check \id

(?:\w{0,3})?: This was intended to allow for an optional prefix like "A" or "PTN". However, \w includes underscores, which might not be what you want if prefixes are strictly alphanumeric. [A-Z0-9]{0,3} is better.
\d{2,3}: Matches 2 or 3 digits (for book number). This is good.
([1-3A-Z]{3}): This is the capturing group for the 3-character book ID. It allows for digits 1, 2, 3 or uppercase letters. This correctly handles books like 1SA, 2CO, 3JN, as well as GEN, MAT, etc.
re.IGNORECASE: This is good as filenames can vary in case.
Observation: The regex seems reasonable for common Paratext naming conventions. If your filenames deviate significantly (e.g., no leading numbers, different ID lengths), it might not match.
Logic in Pre-filtering Loop:

The logic seems mostly sound: if a filename_book_id is extracted and it's canonical but not in the book_filter_list, it continues, skipping the file. This is the fast path.
If filename_book_id can't be extracted, or if it's extracted but deemed non-canonical by filename (which is a bit of a heuristic, as the \id tag is authoritative), it falls through to be processed fully. This is a safe approach.
Why might it still be slow or not filter as expected?

extract_book_id_from_filename Not Matching Often: If the FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN doesn't match a large proportion of your filenames, then most files will fall into the else block (cannot determine book from filename) and be added to files_to_process_fully. This means the pre-filter isn't actually filtering much.

Action: You might need to inspect a sample of your filenames that you expect to be filtered out but aren't. Do they conform to the pattern? For example, if filenames are just GEN.SFM, EXO.SFM (without leading numbers), the current regex won't extract an ID.
is_canonical(filename_book_id) Behavior: If extract_book_id_from_filename extracts something that is_canonical() then flags as non-canonical (e.g., "FRT", "GLO" if they are in NON_CANONICAL_IDS in your canon.py), the current logic is:

python
if not is_canonical(filename_book_id):
    print(f"Info: File '{usfm_file_path_candidate.name}' appears non-canonical by filename ('{filename_book_id}'). Skipping pre-filter for this file (will check \id if processed).")
    files_to_process_fully.append(usfm_file_path_candidate) # Process to be sure
This means it doesn't skip these files at the pre-filtering stage; it defers the decision to the \id tag check. This is a safe choice but means the pre-filter won't skip files named FRT.SFM even if "FRT" is in your book_filter_list (because the is_canonical check comes first).

Refinement Consideration: If a filename_book_id is extracted, and it's not canonical, AND your book_filter_list only contains canonical books, you could potentially skip it at the pre-filter stage too. However, if your book_filter_list might include non-canonical books you specifically want (like "GLO"), then the current deferral is correct.
The tqdm Overhead (Minor): While tqdm is great, for a very fast inner loop (like just filename checking), the overhead of updating the progress bar for every single file in a project during the pre-filter scan might add a tiny bit of perceived slowness if there are thousands of non-USFM files in a project folder that Path(project_path).iterdir() goes through for the project_contains_filtered_books check (though that's in get_project_paths, not the USFM pre-filter). The USFM pre-filter loop itself iterates over usfm_files, which should already be filtered to actual USFM files.

Let's try a slight adjustment to the regex and the pre-filtering logic for clarity and potentially better matching.

The main goal is to ensure extract_book_id_from_filename is as effective as possible and that the pre-filtering logic correctly uses its output.

Proposed Refinement for FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN: Many Paratext files are simply 41MAT.SFM or GEN.SFM. The current regex requires leading digits. Let's make the numeric prefix optional and more flexible, and ensure we capture 3 alphanumeric characters for the book ID.

Explanation of Regex and Logic Changes:

FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN (Line 66, also commented out old one at 191):

Changed to: r"^(?:[A-Z0-9]{0,3})?(?:\d{2,3})?([1-3A-Z]{3})[A-Z0-9\-_]*\.(?:SFM|USFM)$"
^(?:[A-Z0-9]{0,3})?: Optional alphanumeric prefix (0-3 chars).
(?:\d{2,3})?: Optional 2 or 3 digits (book number). Crucially, this is now optional.
([1-3A-Z]{3}): Captures the 3-character book ID (letters or 1,2,3). This is the core part.
[A-Z0-9\-_]*: Allows for any alphanumeric characters, hyphens, or underscores after the book ID but before the extension (e.g., GENAUD.SFM, 01GEN-variant.SFM).
\.(?:SFM|USFM)$: Ensures the file ends with .SFM or .USFM (case-insensitive due to re.IGNORECASE). This makes the regex more specific to USFM files and avoids matching unrelated files.
Pre-filtering Logic (Lines 309-320):

The logic for when filename_book_id is extracted and not is_canonical(filename_book_id) is slightly adjusted:
python
                if not is_canonical(filename_book_id):
                    if book_filter_list and filename_book_id not in book_filter_list:
                        print(f"Info: Skipping file '{usfm_file_path_candidate.name}' (non-canonical book '{filename_book_id}' from filename, not in book_filter_list).")
                        continue
                    else: # Non-canonical by filename, but either no user filter or it IS in user filter (e.g. GLO)
                        print(f"Info: File '{usfm_file_path_candidate.name}' appears non-canonical by filename ('{filename_book_id}'). Will verify with \id tag.")
                        files_to_process_fully.append(usfm_file_path_candidate)
If the filename suggests a non-canonical book (like "GLO"), it now checks if this non-canonical book ID is also absent from the book_filter_list.
If it's non-canonical by filename AND not in the user's specific filter, then it's skipped.
If it's non-canonical by filename BUT it is in the user's filter (e.g., user explicitly wants to process "GLO"), OR if there's no user filter, then the file is added to files_to_process_fully to have its \id tag checked definitively. This allows users to explicitly include non-canonical books in their filter if desired.
To Test This:

Make sure the FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN at the top of the file (around line 66) is the new one.
Run your script with a --book_filter and PROCESS_N_PROJECTS=1 (or a small number).
Observe the "Pre-filtering..." messages.
You should see more "Skipping file..." messages if the new regex correctly identifies book IDs from filenames that are not in your filter.
The overall time spent before the "Analyzing project: ..." message appears for the first project should be significantly reduced if many files are being successfully pre-filtered.
If the pre-filtering is still slow, it would imply that extract_book_id_from_filename is still not matching many of your filenames, meaning most files are still being added to files_to_process_fully. In that case, providing a few examples of filenames that should be filtered but aren't would be very helpful for refining the regex further.

I got this bit of output:

project_analyser.py: 70 lines selected
That seems to suggest that the prefiltering didn't work at all as none were filtered out. Then they were filtered out later once parsed. Is that a correct conclusion?

We should be careful about accepting 2 or 3 digits at the begining of the file name because some Book_ids begin with a number. I think for our purposes we can use filename[2:5] as a way to rapidly obtain the Book ID. It is worth a try, maybe print a warning if the Book returned that way is not in ALL_BOOK_IDS from machine.scripture.canon

You've made a very sharp observation, and your conclusion is correct!

The output:

plaintext
Analyzing project: 1948OT_build32_Uchen...
Pre-filtering 78 USFM files for project 1948OT_build32_Uchen based on filenames and book filter...
Reduced to 78 USFM files for full processing after filename pre-filter.
Info: Skipping book 'EXO' found in 02EXOBSI_OT.SFM (not in book_filter_list).
Info: Skipping book 'LEV' found in 03LEVBSI_OT.SFM (not in book_filter_list).
... (many more "Skipping book" messages) ...
clearly shows:

The "Pre-filtering" step started with 78 USFM files.
It "Reduced to 78 USFM files for full processing after filename pre-filter." This means the pre-filter based on filenames did not actually filter out any files.
Subsequently, the "Skipping book..." messages are appearing. These messages come from inside the loop that tokenizes each file and checks the \id tag. This confirms that the files were indeed opened and partially processed before being skipped.
This means the extract_book_id_from_filename function, or the logic using its result in the pre-filtering stage, isn't effectively identifying and skipping files based on their names.

Your suggestion to use a simpler slice like filename[2:5] (or a similar fixed-position extraction if filenames are very consistent) is a good thought for a rapid check, especially if the current regex is too complex or not matching common patterns in your dataset.

Let's refine extract_book_id_from_filename to try a more direct approach based on common Paratext naming conventions, and then ensure the pre-filtering logic uses this effectively.

Common Paratext Filename Conventions:

Often start with a 2-digit book number (e.g., 01GEN..., 40MAT...).
The 3-letter book ID usually follows immediately after the number.
Sometimes there's a prefix before the number (e.g., A01GEN...).
Sometimes there's no number, and the filename starts directly with the book ID (e.g., GEN.SFM).
Revised Strategy for extract_book_id_from_filename:

Check for a pattern like NNCCC (Number-Number-Char-Char-Char) starting at index 0 or after a short, known prefix.
If not found, check if the filename (without extension) directly matches a 3-letter book ID.
Let's modify extract_book_id_from_filename and the regex. We'll make the regex simpler and more targeted, and then add a fallback for names like GEN.SFM.

Explanation of Changes to extract_book_id_from_filename and Regex:

FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN_NUMPREFIX (Line 67, renamed from FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN):

Changed to: r"^(?:[A-Z])?\d{2}([1-3A-Z]{3})"
^(?:[A-Z])?: Optional single uppercase letter prefix (e.g., for A01GEN...).
\d{2}: Exactly two digits (for the book number). This is more common than 3 digits for book numbers in filenames.
([1-3A-Z]{3}): Captures the 3-character book ID.
The rest of the filename (after the ID) and the extension check are removed from this regex. The goal is to quickly grab the ID from the start of the name if it follows this common numbered pattern.
extract_book_id_from_filename Logic (Lines 199-214):

Priority 1 (Numeric Prefix): It first tries to match FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN_NUMPREFIX. If successful and the extracted ID is valid (via book_id_to_number), it returns it.
Fallback (Direct 3-Letter ID):
If the first pattern doesn't match, it takes the filename stem (filename without extension) using Path(filename_str).stem.
If this stem is exactly 3 characters long, it treats it as a potential book ID (e.g., for "GEN.SFM", stem is "GEN").
It validates this 3-character stem using book_id_to_number. If valid, it's returned.
A warning is printed if a 3-character stem looks like an ID but isn't recognized by canon.py. This can help you identify unusual naming or if your canon.py needs updates for very specific project conventions.
If neither method yields a valid book ID, it returns None.
Why this should be faster and more effective for pre-filtering:

More Targeted Regex: The FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN_NUMPREFIX is now more specific to the most common numbered convention.
Fallback for Simple Names: The fallback explicitly handles XXX.SFM style names.
Early Exit: The pre-filtering loop in analyze_project_data (lines 306-325) will now have a much higher chance of getting a non-None filename_book_id from extract_book_id_from_filename.
If filename_book_id is extracted and it's not in your book_filter_list (and is canonical, or non-canonical but also not in your filter as per the refined logic), the continue statement on line 318 will execute, truly skipping the opening and tokenization of that file.
Testing the Change:

Apply the diff.
Run your script again with the same PROCESS_N_PROJECTS=1 and your book filter.
Observe the output carefully:
The "Pre-filtering N USFM files..." message should still appear.
The "Reduced to M USFM files..." message should now show M being significantly less than N if your book filter is effectively excluding many files based on their names.
You should see "Skipping file..." messages for files correctly identified by name as not being in your filter. These messages should appear during the "Pre-filtering" stage (or immediately after its count message).
The number of "Skipping book..." messages (which come from after tokenization) should drastically reduce, ideally only appearing for files where the filename was ambiguous but the internal \id tag confirmed it should be skipped.
This revised approach should make the filename-based pre-filtering much more effective and give you the speedup you're looking for in that stage.

It looks like we have a couple of NameError issues to sort out, and a good point about the filename pattern!

NameError: name 'FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN' is not defined: This happened because when we refined the regex, we introduced FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN_NUMPREFIX but the extract_book_id_from_filename function was still trying to use the old name FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN.
Error generating detailed report for ...: name 'columns' is not defined: This is a typo in the generate_detailed_project_report function when creating an empty DataFrame for Word_Extremes_Project. It should be columns= not columns==.
Filename Pattern for A01...: You're right, if A01... isn't a common pattern in your actual dataset, we can simplify the regex FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN_NUMPREFIX to not look for that optional 'A' prefix, or make the prefix handling more generic if needed. For now, let's simplify it to just look for the two digits.
Let's fix these.

Changed from r"^(?:[A-Z])?\d{2}([1-3A-Z]{3})" to r"^\d{2}([1-3A-Z]{3})".
This removes the (?:[A-Z])? part, so it no longer looks for an optional single letter prefix like 'A'. It will now only match filenames that start directly with two digits followed by the three-character book ID. This aligns with your observation that A01... type names weren't found.
extract_book_id_from_filename (Line 202):

Changed match = FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN.match(filename_str) to match = FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN_NUMPREFIX.match(filename_str).
This ensures it uses the correctly named regex pattern that we defined.
generate_detailed_project_report (Line 575):

Changed extreme_df = pd.DataFrame(extreme_words_data if extreme_words_data else columns==["Type", "Word", "Length"])
to extreme_df = pd.DataFrame(extreme_words_data if extreme_words_data else columns=["Type", "Word", "Length"]).
The columns== was a typo and should be columns=.
These changes should resolve the NameError for the regex pattern and the NameError related to columns when generating the detailed report. The regex for extracting book IDs from filenames is also now simpler and more focused on the NNCCC... pattern.

Can we try a different method? This one has many difficulties. For example there are more than 99 books listed in ALL_BOOK_IDS, so there may be valid books that begin with three digits. We could read the Settings.xml file for a project, use the naming convention that is specified to create the list of books that need to exist and pass on to the next project if not all of those books are present. How does that sound? It should be more robust I think. Hopefully it will be fast enough.


Gemini
That's a very interesting and potentially more robust approach you're suggesting! Reading the Settings.xml to understand the project's specific naming convention and then checking for the existence of files based on that convention could indeed be more accurate than relying solely on a generic filename parsing regex, especially given the complexities you've highlighted (like more than 99 books, meaning book "numbers" in filenames could be three digits).

This method shifts the "quick check" from regex-on-filenames to "does this project declare a naming convention, and if so, do files matching that convention for my filtered books exist?"

Here's a breakdown of how this could work and the implications:

Proposed New Approach for project_contains_filtered_books (and by extension, the early exit in get_project_paths):

Read Settings.xml Early: Inside project_contains_filtered_books, the first step for a given project_path would be to parse its Settings.xml file using FileParatextProjectSettingsParser.
Get Naming Convention: From the parsed settings object, extract the naming convention details:
settings.filename_form (e.g., "NUMBOOKNAM", "BOOKNAMNUM", "BOOKNAM")
settings.filename_pre_part (prefix, often empty)
settings.filename_post_part (suffix, often empty or like "_OT", "_NT")
Construct Expected Filenames: For each book_id in your active_book_filter_for_scan:
Get the book number using book_id_to_number(book_id).
Based on the filename_form, filename_pre_part, filename_post_part, book ID, and book number, construct the expected base filename (without the .SFM or .usfm extension).
Example for "NUMBOOKNAM": prefix + "{:02d}".format(book_num) + book_id + postfix (need to handle 3-digit book numbers if filename_form implies it or if book_num >= 100). sil-machine might have utilities for this filename construction, or we'd implement a small helper.
Check File Existence: For each constructed expected base filename, check if expected_base_filename + ".SFM" or expected_base_filename + ".usfm" exists in the project_path.
Qualify Project: If at least one of the filtered books' expected files exists, the project "qualifies" for the early exit scan.
Advantages:

More Robust: Directly uses the project's declared naming convention, which should be more accurate than a generic regex.
Handles >99 Books: If the naming convention implies 3-digit numbers for books (e.g., if filename_form was something like "NNNBOOKNAM"), this approach can be adapted.
Accuracy: Less prone to false positives or negatives from regex mismatches if filenames are unusual but conform to the project's own settings.
Potential Challenges and Considerations:

Performance of Parsing Settings.xml: Parsing an XML file for every single project folder during the initial scan in get_project_paths will be slower than just listing directory contents and applying a regex to filenames. If you have thousands of folders, this initial scan could take noticeably longer. However, it might still be faster overall if it prevents many more projects from being added to candidate_paths that would later be fully (and slowly) analyzed only to be skipped.
Missing or Malformed Settings.xml: If Settings.xml is missing or can't be parsed for a project, project_contains_filtered_books would need a fallback (e.g., assume it doesn't qualify, or fall back to a simpler filename check, or mark it for full processing).
Complexity of Filename Construction: Accurately reconstructing all possible Paratext filename variations based on the settings can be a bit intricate. sil-machine's ParatextProjectSettings object might already have a method or properties that give you the constructed filename for a given book ID/number, which would be ideal. If not, we'd need to replicate that logic carefully.
Default Naming Convention: If Settings.xml doesn't specify a full convention, Paratext has defaults. The FileParatextProjectSettingsParser should ideally provide these defaults.
Is it Fast Enough?

The file existence check (Path.exists()) is very fast.
The main overhead is parsing Settings.xml for each project during the get_project_paths scan.
Trade-off: You're trading a potentially slower initial scan (due to XML parsing) for a more accurate pre-qualification of projects, which could lead to fewer projects undergoing the much slower full USFM tokenization later.
If PROCESS_N_PROJECTS is small, and this method quickly finds N qualifying projects, the overall time could be much less than scanning all folders and then fully processing many non-qualifying ones.
Let's try to sketch out the implementation for project_contains_filtered_books using this new approach. We'll assume sil-machine's settings object gives us the necessary naming parts.

Key Changes in project_contains_filtered_books:

Parse Settings.xml: It now attempts to parse Settings.xml for the given project_path.
Get Naming Parts: It uses getattr to fetch filename_pre_part, filename_post_part, and filename_form, providing defaults if these attributes are missing from the settings object.
Filename Construction (Simplified Example):
It iterates through the book_id_filter from the book_filter_list.
It constructs an base_filename based on a few common form values ("NUMBOOKNAM", "BOOKNAMNUM", "BOOKNAM").
Crucial Simplification/Heuristic for Book Number Padding: It defaults to 2-digit padding for the book number (f"{book_num:02d}"). It includes a simple heuristic to switch to 3 digits if "NNN" is in the form string or if the book number is >= 100 and "NUM" is in the form. This part is the most complex to get perfectly right without replicating Paratext's exact internal logic or having a direct utility from sil-machine. Paratext's own behavior for 2 vs. 3 digits can depend on the "Use 3-digit book numbers" setting within Paratext, which might not be directly exposed in Settings.xml in a simple way.
File Existence Check: It checks for .SFM or .usfm files matching the constructed base_filename.
Return Value: Returns True if any of the filtered book files are found, False otherwise. Includes basic try-except for robustness during settings parsing.
How this Impacts get_project_paths:

The get_project_paths function will call this new project_contains_filtered_books. If it returns True, the project is considered "qualifying" for the early exit scan when limit_n_projects_to_scan is active.

Next Steps and Refinements:

Test Performance: See how this impacts the initial scan time. Parsing XML for every project will add overhead. The question is whether this overhead is less than the time saved by not fully tokenizing many non-qualifying projects later.
Robustness of Filename Construction: This is the trickiest part.
Ideal Scenario: Investigate if sil-machine's ParatextProjectSettings object has a method like get_expected_filename(book_id) or get_expected_filename(book_number). If such a utility exists, using it would be far more reliable than reconstructing the logic. You might need to look at the sil-machine source code for ParatextTextCorpus or related classes to see how they determine filenames.
If No Utility: You'll need to make the filename construction logic in project_contains_filtered_books as robust as possible by handling more filename_form variations and the 2-digit vs. 3-digit book number logic more precisely if it becomes a point of failure. The current heuristic is a starting point.
Error Handling for Settings.xml: Decide on the behavior if Settings.xml can't be parsed for a project during this pre-scan. The current code has comments suggesting returning False (don't qualify) or True (qualify to be safe and check fully later). Returning False is more aggressive in pre-filtering.
This approach is definitely more aligned with using the project's own metadata, which is a good principle. The main challenge will be the performance of the initial scan and the accuracy of the filename construction if a direct sil-machine utility isn't readily available for it.

Here are some clarifications: settings.filename_form is almost always 41MAT indicatting two digits and the Book ID. The 41 is significant because the first 39 books of the OT are usually numbered from 01 to 39 MAT at the begining of the NT is usually numbered 41 These kinds of domain specific information are, of course, the resaon that it's so helpful to make as much use of machine.scripture as possible. settings.filename_pre_part (prefix, often empty) Yes the prefix is often empty. settings.filename_post_part: The suffix or post part is never empty. At very least it contains a '.SFM' or other file extension. We haven't dealt with all the extensions. SFM and USFM are common but .ptx isn't unknown and there are probably others.

Let's remove as many regexes as we can from the code and see where we can depend more on machine.py


Gemini
It's excellent that you're diving deeper into the specifics of Paratext naming conventions and aiming to leverage sil-machine more! You're absolutely right about the significance of book numbering (like MAT being 40, not 41, in standard canon, though project-specific numbering can vary) and the structure of filenames.

Let's refine the project_contains_filtered_books function to be more robust by:

Relying less on complex regex for filename parsing if we can use the project's own settings.
Being more explicit about how we construct filenames based on Settings.xml.
Handling file extensions more broadly.
The core idea is that FileParatextProjectSettingsParser from sil-machine should give us the filename_form, filename_pre_part, and filename_post_part. We can then use these to construct the expected filename for a given book ID.

Revised Strategy for project_contains_filtered_books:

Parse Settings.xml: This remains the first step.
Get Naming Convention Parts: Extract filename_form, filename_pre_part, and filename_post_part from the parsed settings. Provide sensible defaults if any are missing (though filename_form is crucial).
Iterate Through Filtered Books: For each book_id_filter in the active_book_filter_for_scan:
Get the canonical book number using book_id_to_number(book_id_filter).
Construct Expected Filename Stem: This is the most critical part. We need a helper function that takes the book ID, book number, and the naming convention parts (form, pre_part, post_part) and returns the expected filename stem (without the extension).
The form string (e.g., "NUMBOOKNAM", "BOOKNAMNUM", "BOOKNAM", "41MAT") dictates how the number and ID are combined.
If the form is like "41MAT", it implies a specific numbering scheme that might override the canonical book number for filename generation. We need to be careful here. sil-machine's internal logic for ParatextTextCorpus likely handles this perfectly when it identifies files. We aim to replicate a simplified version for this quick check.
The filename_pre_part is prepended.
The filename_post_part (excluding the extension part for now) is appended.
Check File Existence with Multiple Extensions: For the constructed stem, check for existence with common extensions (.SFM, .usfm, .ptx, etc.).
Removing Regex for Filename Parsing:

The extract_book_id_from_filename function and its associated FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN_NUMPREFIX regex can be removed if we fully rely on constructing filenames from Settings.xml for the pre-scan. The pre-scan will become a check of "does a file exist that should exist for this filtered book, given the project's settings?"

This is a significant shift. The pre-filtering in analyze_project_data will no longer try to extract a book ID from existing filenames to see if that file should be skipped. Instead, project_contains_filtered_books (called by get_project_paths) will determine if a project folder is a candidate by checking if any of the required book files (based on the filter and settings) seem to exist.

Let's implement this. It will involve creating a new helper for filename construction.

         for usfm_file_path in files_to_process_fully:

Key Changes and Explanations:

Removed FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN_NUMPREFIX and extract_book_id_from_filename:

The regex for filename parsing and the function using it are removed (lines 67-68, 200-215). The pre-filtering of USFM files within analyze_project_data based on their individual names is removed.
New construct_expected_filename_stem Function (Lines 112-148):

This function is the core of the new logic for project_contains_filtered_books.
It takes book_id, book_num, form, pre_part, and post_part (assumed to be the part of the suffix before the extension).
Number Padding: It includes a heuristic for 2-digit vs. 3-digit book numbers. If "NNN" is in the form_upper or if book_num >= 100 (and "NUM" is in the form, implying numbers are used), it uses 3-digit padding; otherwise, 2-digit. This is still a heuristic and the most complex part to get universally correct without deeper sil-machine integration for filename generation.
Form-Specific Number: It attempts to handle forms like "41MAT" where the number might be explicitly part of the form string for that specific book. It uses a regex rf"(\d{{2,3}}){book_id}" to extract such a number from the form if the book_id matches.
Core Filename Construction: Based on common form values ("NUMBOOKNAM", "BOOKNAMNUM", "BOOKNAM"), it assembles the core part of the filename.
Fallback: If the form is unrecognized but contains the book_id (e.g., form is "40MAT"), it assumes the form itself is the core. Otherwise, it defaults to a "NUMBOOKNAM" like structure and prints a warning.
Returns the constructed stem: pre_part + filename_core + post_part.
Revised project_contains_filtered_books Function (Lines 151-181):

It now parses Settings.xml using FileParatextProjectSettingsParser.
It retrieves filename_pre_part, filename_post_part, and filename_form using getattr with defaults.
Important Note on post_part_setting: The filename_post_part from Settings.xml often includes the extension (e.g., _NT.SFM). The construct_expected_filename_stem function expects the post_part without the extension. The current implementation passes post_part_setting directly. This might lead to filenames like PRE01GENPOST_NT.SFM.SFM. This needs careful handling. A robust solution would be to strip known extensions from post_part_setting before passing it or to have construct_expected_filename_stem be smarter about it. For now, I've kept it simple, but this is a key area for potential bugs depending on actual filename_post_part values.
For each book_id_filter, it calls construct_expected_filename_stem.
It then checks for the existence of this stem with a list of common extensions (.SFM, .usfm, .ptx, .txt). You can expand this list.
Returns True if any such file is found.
analyze_project_data - Pre-filtering Section Removed (Lines 337-352):

The block of code that iterated through usfm_files to pre-filter them using extract_book_id_from_filename is removed.
The responsibility for deciding if a project folder is even worth considering (based on book filters) is now entirely within get_project_paths via its call to project_contains_filtered_books.
analyze_project_data will now receive a project path that has already passed this initial qualification. It will then find all USFM files within that project and apply the book_filter_list after tokenizing and reading the \id tag from each file (which is the definitive check).
Implications and Next Steps:

Performance:
The get_project_paths initial scan will be slower because it's parsing Settings.xml for every potential project folder to run project_contains_filtered_books.
However, if PROCESS_N_PROJECTS is set and project_contains_filtered_books is effective, it might find the N qualifying projects much faster and stop the overall directory scan sooner.
The analyze_project_data function itself will no longer have its own (potentially slow) USFM file pre-filtering loop.
Accuracy of construct_expected_filename_stem: This is now the linchpin.
Test thoroughly with diverse project naming conventions.
The handling of filename_post_part (especially if it includes the extension) and the 2-digit vs. 3-digit book number logic are the most likely places for refinement.
Ideal Solution (Long-term): If sil-machine has a utility function that takes a ParatextProjectSettings object and a book_id (or book_num) and returns the expected filename(s) for that book according to those settings, that would be the most robust way to implement the file existence check in project_contains_filtered_books. This would abstract away all the complexities of form, pre/post parts, and numbering. You might find such logic within ParatextTextCorpus._get_file_path() or similar methods in sil-machine.
File Extensions: The project_contains_filtered_books now checks a list [".SFM", ".usfm", ".ptx", ".txt"]. Ensure this covers all relevant extensions in your dataset.
This is a significant architectural change to the pre-filtering. It has the potential to be more robust by respecting project-specific settings but introduces its own complexities in accurately reconstructing filenames. Careful testing is key!

I have copied paratext_project_settings.py to see whether the get_book_id function within that is useful to us for this part of the code. The code also contains get_book_file_name which takes a book_id and returns the file name according to the details from the Settings.xml file.


Gemini
That's a fantastic move to bring in the ParatextProjectSettings class and its methods! You're absolutely right, get_book_file_name(self, book_id: str) is precisely the kind of utility from sil-machine that we want to leverage. It encapsulates Paratext's complex filename generation logic based on the project's settings.

This will make the project_contains_filtered_books function much more robust and accurate, and we can remove our custom construct_expected_filename_stem helper function.

Here's how we can integrate this:

Modify project_contains_filtered_books:

It will still parse Settings.xml to get the settings object (which will be an instance of ParatextProjectSettings if your local copy is correctly integrated or if FileParatextProjectSettingsParser returns an object with a compatible interface).
For each book_id_filter in your book_filter_list, it will call settings.get_book_file_name(book_id_filter). This method should return the complete expected filename, including prefix, core, suffix, and the extension (e.g., "01GEN_NT.SFM").
It will then simply check if this exact filename exists in the project directory.
Remove construct_expected_filename_stem: This helper function will no longer be needed.

Explanation of Changes:

Removed construct_expected_filename_stem (Lines 112-178 in old code): This entire helper function is no longer needed.

Revised project_contains_filtered_books (Lines 112-137 in new code):

It still parses Settings.xml to get the settings object.
Crucial Check: It now includes if not hasattr(settings, 'get_book_file_name'): return False. This is important because if your local paratext_project_settings.py isn't correctly integrated or if FileParatextProjectSettingsParser returns a different kind of settings object that lacks this method, we want to gracefully assume the project doesn't qualify for the pre-scan.
It iterates through your book_filter_list.
For each book_id_filter, it calls expected_filename = settings.get_book_file_name(book_id_filter).
The get_book_file_name method from your paratext_project_settings.py (which you copied from sil-machine) is expected to return the full filename including the extension (e.g., "01GEN_PrefSuf.SFM").
It then directly checks if (project_path / expected_filename).exists().
A try-except block is added around settings.get_book_file_name() because this method might raise an exception if, for example, the book_id_filter is invalid or not applicable to the project's specific versification/settings (though book_id_to_number inside get_book_file_name should handle basic ID validity).
The debug print statements are commented out but can be re-enabled if you need to trace issues.
Important Considerations for this to Work:

Correct ParatextProjectSettings Object: The settings object returned by FileParatextProjectSettingsParser(str(project_path)).parse() must be an instance of the ParatextProjectSettings class (or a class with an identical interface) that you have in your local paratext_project_settings.py.

If FileParatextProjectSettingsParser is part of the standard sil.machine.corpora and it returns its own internal settings object type, that internal type must have a get_book_file_name method with the same signature and behavior.
If you've copied paratext_project_settings.py into your project and FileParatextProjectSettingsParser is also local or modified to use your local class, then it should work.
The most common scenario is that FileParatextProjectSettingsParser is from the installed sil-machine library. You need to ensure that the ParatextProjectSettings class it instantiates and returns has that get_book_file_name method. Looking at the sil-machine source for FileParatextProjectSettingsParser.parse() would confirm what type of object it returns and what methods are available on it. The paratext_project_settings.py you provided is the definition from sil-machine, so this should align.
Behavior of settings.get_book_file_name():

You need to be sure it correctly handles all the filename_form variations, prefixes, suffixes, and book number padding (2-digit vs. 3-digit) as implemented in your local paratext_project_settings.py (which is from sil-machine). The code for _get_book_file_name_digits in that file has specific logic for numbers < 10, < 40, < 100, and then A, B, C prefixes for higher numbers, which seems quite comprehensive.
It also correctly appends the file_name_suffix which typically includes the extension.
Advantages of this New Approach:

Leverages sil-machine Logic: You are now directly using sil-machine's own understanding of how to construct filenames for a project, which is the most robust way.
Removes Custom Regex/Heuristics: No more trying to guess filename patterns with your own regex or complex conditional logic for number padding in project_analyser.py.
Handles Extensions Correctly: settings.get_book_file_name() should return the full filename including the correct extension as defined by file_name_suffix.
This is a much cleaner and more reliable way to perform the pre-scan check. The main dependency is ensuring that the settings object you get from FileParatextProjectSettingsParser indeed has the get_book_file_name method and that it behaves as expected by the sil-machine definition.

David Baines
To update the current project_analyser.py code will we need to import the ParatextProjectSettings class from machine.corpora.paratext_project_settings Rather than checking "if not hasattr(settings, 'get_book_file_name'):" I'm really not sure.


Gemini
It's great that you're thinking about the best way to use the ParatextProjectSettings class and its get_book_file_name method! You're on the right track.

You are correct. To properly use settings.get_book_file_name(book_id_filter), the settings object returned by FileParatextProjectSettingsParser(str(project_path)).parse() needs to be an instance of the ParatextProjectSettings class (or a class that duck-types it by having that method).

Regarding your import question:

The line you already have:

python
# f:\GitHub\davidbaines\project_analyser\project_analyser\project_analyser.py
# ...
    from machine.corpora.paratext_project_settings import ParatextProjectSettings
# ...
This import is correct if you intend to type hint or instantiate ParatextProjectSettings directly in your project_analyser.py script. However, FileParatextProjectSettingsParser (which is imported from machine.corpora) is the class responsible for creating and returning an instance of ParatextProjectSettings (or a compatible settings object).

So, you don't necessarily need to import ParatextProjectSettings just to call methods on the object returned by settings_parser.parse(). Python's dynamic typing (duck typing) means that as long as the settings object has a method called get_book_file_name, you can call it.

The hasattr(settings, 'get_book_file_name') check is a good defensive measure for a few reasons:

Robustness: If, for some unexpected reason, settings_parser.parse() returns an object that isn't a fully-formed ParatextProjectSettings instance or is None, calling a method directly without checking could lead to an AttributeError.
Library Evolution: While unlikely for such a core method, if sil-machine were to change the method name or remove it in a future version, hasattr would prevent your script from breaking immediately.
Different Settings Objects: In complex systems, a parser might sometimes return different types of settings objects based on input. hasattr ensures you're only calling the method if it's appropriate for the object you received.
However, given that FileParatextProjectSettingsParser is specifically designed to produce ParatextProjectSettings objects (or objects that behave identically for core functionalities), you can often rely on the method being present if settings itself is not None.

The paratext_project_settings.py file you provided shows that get_book_file_name is indeed a method of the ParatextProjectSettings class.

Refinement to project_contains_filtered_books:

The current logic in project_contains_filtered_books is:

python
# f:\GitHub\davidbaines\project_analyser\project_analyser\project_analyser.py
# ...
    try:
        settings_parser = FileParatextProjectSettingsParser(str(project_path))
        settings = settings_parser.parse()
        if not settings:
            # print(f"Debug: Could not parse Settings.xml for {project_path.name} during pre-scan. Assuming it doesn't qualify.")
            return False 

        # Ensure the settings object has the get_book_file_name method
        if not hasattr(settings, 'get_book_file_name'):
            # print(f"Debug: Parsed settings for {project_path.name} does not have 'get_book_file_name' method. Assuming it doesn't qualify.")
            return False 

        for book_id_filter in book_filter_list:
            try:
                expected_filename = settings.get_book_file_name(book_id_filter)
                if (project_path / expected_filename).exists():
                    return True 
            except Exception as e_fn:
                # print(f"Debug: Error calling get_book_file_name for {book_id_filter} in {project_path.name}: {e_fn}")
                continue 
# ...
This is already quite good. The if not settings: check handles cases where parsing Settings.xml fails. The if not hasattr(settings, 'get_book_file_name'): is an extra layer of safety.

Could you remove the hasattr check?

Yes, you probably could, with minimal risk, if settings_parser.parse() consistently returns either a ParatextProjectSettings instance (which will have the method) or None.
The primary risk of removing it is if settings_parser.parse() could, under some rare circumstance, return an object that is not None but also not a ParatextProjectSettings instance and lacks the method. This seems unlikely for this specific parser.
Recommendation:

For maximum robustness, keeping the hasattr check is fine. It adds very little overhead and guards against unexpected object types.

If you want to slightly streamline and assume that if settings is not None, it will be a ParatextProjectSettings object (which is a reasonable assumption given the parser's purpose), you could remove the hasattr check. The try-except block around settings.get_book_file_name(book_id_filter) would then catch any AttributeError if the method was unexpectedly missing, though the if not settings: check should catch most problematic cases earlier.

No code changes are strictly necessary based on your question if the current code is working. The import of ParatextProjectSettings in your project_analyser.py (line 49) is primarily for type hinting or if you were to instantiate it directly, not a strict requirement for calling methods on an object returned by another part of the sil-machine library.

The current structure of project_contains_filtered_books looks solid for leveraging settings.get_book_file_name. The most important part is that FileParatextProjectSettingsParser returns an object that actually is or behaves like the ParatextProjectSettings class you've shown.

Let me know if you'd like to explore the slight simplification of removing the hasattr check, but as it stands, it's a safe approach.

It looks like there are a couple of lingering NameError issues from previous refactorings.

NameError: name 'FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN' is not defined: This is happening because the extract_book_id_from_filename function is still trying to use the old regex name FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN, but we renamed the active regex to FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN_NUMPREFIX and then later decided to remove the regex-based extraction from extract_book_id_from_filename altogether when we switched to using settings.get_book_file_name(). It seems the extract_book_id_from_filename function itself and its call in the pre-filtering loop within analyze_project_data were not fully removed or were partially reintroduced.

Error generating detailed report for ...: name 'columns' is not defined: This is the same typo we addressed before in generate_detailed_project_report when creating an empty DataFrame for Word_Extremes_Project. It should be columns= not columns==. It seems this fix might not have been correctly applied or was reverted.

Let's correct these. The main action will be to remove the extract_book_id_from_filename function and the pre-filtering loop within analyze_project_data that uses it, as the project_contains_filtered_books (which uses settings.get_book_file_name) is now responsible for the pre-qualification of project folders.

Explanation of Changes:

Removed FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN_NUMPREFIX (Line 67): The regex constant is no longer needed as we are not parsing filenames with regex in analyze_project_data.
Removed extract_book_id_from_filename function (Lines 217-229 in previous version): This entire function is removed.
Removed Pre-filtering Loop in analyze_project_data (Lines 337-352 in previous version): The block of code that started with if book_filter_list and usfm_files: and called extract_book_id_from_filename has been removed. The files_to_process_fully list is now directly assigned from usfm_files. The actual filtering of books now happens after tokenization based on the \id tag, which is more reliable. The pre-qualification of project folders is handled by get_project_paths using project_contains_filtered_books (which in turn uses settings.get_book_file_name).
Corrected columns== to columns= (Line 575): The typo in the Word_Extremes_Project DataFrame creation is fixed again.
Why this should fix the errors:

The NameError: name 'FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN' is not defined will be resolved because the extract_book_id_from_filename function that was trying to use it (and the regex itself) has been removed. The call to extract_book_id_from_filename from within analyze_project_data has also been removed.
The NameError: name 'columns' is not defined will be resolved by correcting the typo to columns=.
The output you saw:

Analyzing project: 1948OT_build32_Uchen...
Pre-filtering 78 USFM files for project 1948OT_build32_Uchen based on filenames and book filter...
This "Pre-filtering..." message was coming from the now-removed block within analyze_project_data. Since that block is gone, you will no longer see this specific message.

The filtering process is now:

get_project_paths: Scans directories. If limit_n_projects and active_book_filter are set, it calls project_contains_filtered_books for each potential project folder.
project_contains_filtered_books: Parses Settings.xml for that project, uses settings.get_book_file_name() for each book in your active_book_filter, and checks if those files exist. This determines if the project folder qualifies for the initial scan limit.
analyze_project_data: Once a project folder is selected for full analysis:
It gets all USFM files within that project.
It tokenizes each USFM file.
When an \id (BOOK) token is found, it extracts the book_code_candidate.
It then checks this book_code_candidate against is_canonical() and your active_book_filter. If it should be skipped, the "Info: Skipping book..." message is printed, and processing for that book's tokens stops.
This revised structure should be more robust and correctly use the sil-machine utilities for determining expected filenames.

The difference between: extreme_df = pd.DataFrame(extreme_words_data if extreme_words_data else columns==["Type", "Word", "Length"]) and extreme_df = pd.DataFrame(extreme_words_data if extreme_words_data else columns=["Type", "Word", "Length"]) is just the == or single = sign. When there is a single = sign there is a syntax error produced that asks whether I meant to use two equals signs.

Can you explain this a bit?


Gemini
You've run into a common point of confusion with Python's syntax, especially around conditional expressions (the "ternary operator") and function arguments! Let's break down what's happening with those lines.

The core of the issue lies in how Python interprets this structure: pd.DataFrame(A if C else B)

This means:

Evaluate the condition C.
If C is true, the expression (A if C else B) evaluates to A.
If C is false, the expression (A if C else B) evaluates to B.
The result of this entire expression is then passed as the first (positional) argument to pd.DataFrame().
The key is that B (the else part) must be an expression that produces a value.

Let's look at your two versions:

Version 1 (with ==, syntactically valid but semantically wrong for your goal):

python
extreme_df = pd.DataFrame(extreme_words_data if extreme_words_data else columns==["Type", "Word", "Length"])
If extreme_words_data is empty (falsy), the else part is evaluated: columns==["Type", "Word", "Length"].
This is a comparison expression. It checks if a variable named columns (which would need to be defined elsewhere in your scope) is equal to the list ["Type", "Word", "Length"].
This comparison will produce a boolean value: True or False.
So, the call effectively becomes pd.DataFrame(True) or pd.DataFrame(False).
This is valid Python syntax (no error), but it's not what you intend. You don't want to create a DataFrame from a boolean; you want an empty DataFrame with specific column names.
Version 2 (with single =, which causes the SyntaxError):

python
extreme_df = pd.DataFrame(extreme_words_data if extreme_words_data else columns=["Type", "Word", "Length"])
If extreme_words_data is empty (falsy), Python tries to evaluate the else part: columns=["Type", "Word", "Length"].
The problem is that columns=["Type", "Word", "Length"] is not an expression that produces a value in this context. It's Python's syntax for passing a keyword argument to a function.
The ternary operator ... if ... else ... expects its else part to be a value-producing expression. It cannot directly be a keyword argument assignment.
This is why you get a SyntaxError: invalid syntax. The interpreter sees columns= in a place where it expects a value for the else clause. The suggestion "Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead?" comes up because:
== would make it a comparison (like Version 1).
:= (the "walrus operator," Python 3.8+) is an assignment expression which does produce a value, but it's not the right tool here for simply defining columns for an empty DataFrame.
The Correct Way to Achieve Your Goal

You want to create a DataFrame from extreme_words_data if it's not empty, or an empty DataFrame with specified columns if extreme_words_data is empty.

The most straightforward and readable way is often a simple if/else statement:

python
if extreme_words_data:
    extreme_df = pd.DataFrame(extreme_words_data) 
    # Pandas will infer columns from the list of dicts if extreme_words_data is structured that way.
    # If you want to ensure specific columns even when data is present, you can add them:
    # extreme_df = pd.DataFrame(extreme_words_data, columns=["Type", "Word", "Length"])
else:
    extreme_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=["Type", "Word", "Length"])
If you want to use a single line with the ternary operator, you need to ensure the else part provides valid data for pd.DataFrame(), and then specify the columns argument separately to the pd.DataFrame constructor:

python
extreme_df = pd.DataFrame(
    extreme_words_data if extreme_words_data else [],  # Provide empty list as data if no extreme_words_data
    columns=["Type", "Word", "Length"]  # Always specify columns
)
In this corrected one-liner:

If extreme_words_data is not empty, extreme_words_data is passed as the first argument (data).
If extreme_words_data is empty, an empty list [] is passed as the first argument (data).
In both cases, columns=["Type", "Word", "Length"] is passed as a keyword argument to pd.DataFrame(). This correctly tells Pandas what the columns should be, especially when the data is an empty list.

                for w in shortest: extreme_words_data.append({"Type": "Shortest", "Word": w, "Length": len(w)})
                for w in longest: extreme_words_data.append({"Type": "Longest", "Word": w, "Length": len(w)}) # Fixed typo here
            extreme_df = pd.DataFrame(extreme_words_data if extreme_words_data else columns==["Type", "Word", "Length"])
                for w in longest: extreme_words_data.append({"Type": "Longest", "Word": w, "Length": len(w)})
            extreme_df = pd.DataFrame(extreme_words_data if extreme_words_data else columns=["Type", "Word", "Length"])
            extreme_df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="Word_Extremes_Project", index=False)
The + line here, extreme_df = pd.DataFrame(extreme_words_data if extreme_words_data else columns=["Type", "Word", "Length"]), was indeed syntactically incorrect for the reason explained above. My apologies if that was a suggestion from me that caused confusion!

The robust solution is:

python
            extreme_df = pd.DataFrame(extreme_words_data if extreme_words_data else [], columns=["Type", "Word", "Length"])
This ensures that pd.DataFrame always receives valid data (either extreme_words_data or an empty list []) as its first positional argument, and the columns are specified correctly as a keyword argument.

The project_results dictionary initialization in analyze_project_data.
The lines that populate these fields from the settings object in analyze_project_data.

Can you help me by cleaning up the import statements. I'd like to leave them all in for the moment even if not used, as reminders that those parts of code may be useful. Let's remove the checking though and tidy up the order.


Gemini
Certainly! Cleaning up import statements can make the code much more readable and maintainable. It's a good practice to group them and order them logically.

Based on your request, we'll keep all the imports you currently have, remove the try-except-sys.exit() blocks around them (as they can be disruptive during development if a specific component isn't immediately needed or if there's a temporary environment issue), and organize them.

A common convention for ordering imports is:

Standard library imports (e.g., os, sys, re, datetime).
Third-party library imports (e.g., pandas, dotenv, tqdm, unicodedataplus).
Local application/library specific imports (e.g., machine.corpora, machine.scripture).
Let's apply this to your project_analyser.py.

Key Changes in the Import Section:

Grouping and Ordering:

Standard library imports like argparse, os, re, sys, collections, datetime, typing, and pathlib are grouped at the top.
Third-party imports (pandas, dotenv, tqdm, unicodedataplus) follow.
Local application/library imports (all the machine.* imports) are grouped last.
Removal of Multiple try-except-sys.exit() Blocks:

The individual try-except ImportError: ... sys.exit(1) blocks around specific groups of sil-machine imports have been removed.
A single, more general try-except ImportError block now wraps all the sil-machine specific imports.
The sys.exit(1) call within this block has been removed. Now, it just prints a warning: "Warning: One or more sil-machine components could not be imported. Functionality may be limited."
Rationale for removing sys.exit(1): During development, if a particular sil-machine component isn't strictly necessary for the part of the code you're currently testing, having the script exit immediately can be disruptive. A warning allows the script to continue (if possible), and Python will raise a NameError later if an unimported name is actually used. This often gives more direct feedback on what's missing when it's actually needed. If a critical component is missing, the script will likely fail soon after with a NameError anyway.
Minor Cleanup:

is_cell_range was removed from the UsfmStylesheet import line as it didn't appear to be used elsewhere in the project_analyser.py script. If it is used and I missed it, it can easily be added back.
This revised import structure should be cleaner and more aligned with common Python style guides, while still keeping all the imports available as you requested. The removal of the aggressive sys.exit() calls should also make the development and testing workflow a bit smoother if you're working in an environment where some optional sil-machine components might not always be present or if you're testing parts of the script that don't depend on every single import.

Let's look again at the code that skips files with the filter. Was that removed? It seems as though it is only Skipping and printing "Info: Skipping book '2JN' found in 642JN222MPV.SFM (not in book_filter_list). Info: Skipping book '3JN' found in 653JN222MPV.SFM (not in book_filter_list)." for example.

So it is still filtering very slowly.


Gemini
You're absolutely right to bring this up again! It seems my previous response about removing the extract_book_id_from_filename and its associated pre-filtering loop in analyze_project_data was either not fully applied in the last diff I provided, or I misunderstood which part of the filtering you were referring to as being slow.

The "Skipping book..." messages like:

plaintext
Info: Skipping book '2JN' found in 642JN222MPV.SFM (not in book_filter_list).
Info: Skipping book '3JN' found in 653JN222MPV.SFM (not in book_filter_list).
are generated from inside the analyze_project_data function, specifically after a USFM file has been opened, its content read, and the UsfmTokenizer has processed it to find an \id (BOOK) token. This is indeed the slower way to filter individual files if a faster, filename-based pre-filter could have already excluded them.

The intention of the project_contains_filtered_books function (which uses settings.get_book_file_name()) was to pre-filter project folders during the get_project_paths stage, so that analyze_project_data wouldn't even be called for projects that don't seem to contain the desired books.

However, once analyze_project_data is called for a project that passed the folder-level pre-qualification, it then processes all USFM files within that project. The current filtering within analyze_project_data happens after tokenizing each file.

The extract_book_id_from_filename logic and the loop that used it for pre-filtering USFM files within analyze_project_data should indeed have been removed if we are relying on the \id tag check for individual files within a selected project.

It seems the NameError for FILENAME_BOOK_ID_PATTERN was because the call to extract_book_id_from_filename was still present in analyze_project_data, but the regex constant it depended on was removed.

Let's ensure that the pre-filtering loop for individual USFM files within analyze_project_data (the one that was causing the NameError) is definitely removed. The filtering of books within analyze_project_data should only happen after the \id tag is read from the token stream.

The project_contains_filtered_books function, used by get_project_paths, is responsible for the initial, fast qualification of project folders. If a project folder passes this, then analyze_project_data is called. Inside analyze_project_data, when it iterates through the USFM files of that qualified project, it will then check the \id tag of each file against the book_filter_list.

The NameError you encountered indicates that the call to extract_book_id_from_filename (and thus the pre-filtering loop for individual SFM files inside analyze_project_data) was still in your code.

Let's re-verify the section in analyze_project_data that handles usfm_files and ensure any filename-based pre-filtering loop there is removed. The previous diff I sent (the one that fixed the NameError: name 'columns' is not defined) already showed this removal.

Here's the relevant part of analyze_project_data from that diff, which should be the current state if that diff was applied:

                            # ... set current_book_id_for_file = None and continue ...
                        if book_filter_list and book_code_candidate not in book_filter_list:
                            print(f"Info: Skipping book '{book_code_candidate}' found in {usfm_file_path.name} (not in book_filter_list).") # <-- THIS IS THE SLOW SKIP
                            # ... set current_book_id_for_file = None and continue ...
                        # ...
                # ...
Why the "Skipping book..." messages are still appearing one by one (the "slow skip"):

You are correct. The current design is:

get_project_paths uses project_contains_filtered_books to quickly check if a project folder likely contains any of the books in your active_book_filter. This is the fast, folder-level pre-qualification. If a project folder doesn't seem to have any of the books you want, analyze_project_data is never even called for it.
If a project folder does pass this initial check (meaning it might contain at least one book you're interested in), then analyze_project_data is called.
Inside analyze_project_data, it iterates through all USFM files found in that project (files_to_process_fully = usfm_files).
For each of these USFM files, it opens it, reads it, and tokenizes it.
Only after tokenization, when it encounters the \id (BOOK) token, does it check if that specific book is in your book_filter_list. If not, it prints "Info: Skipping book..." and then continues to the next token in that same file (or effectively skips meaningful processing for that book within the file).
So, the "slow skip" you're observing is because each individual USFM file within a qualified project folder is still being opened and tokenized up to its \id tag.

Can we make the skipping of individual files within a qualified project faster?

Yes, we could reintroduce a filename-based check for individual USFM files inside analyze_project_data, but this time using the settings.get_book_file_name() method if possible, or a simplified direct filename check.

The challenge is that settings.get_book_file_name(book_id) requires you to know the book_id to generate the expected filename. To get the book_id from a filename reliably without parsing the \id tag, we'd be back to needing something like extract_book_id_from_filename (which we removed due to its own complexities and the NameError).

Alternative to Speed Up Skipping Within analyze_project_data:

If the settings.get_book_id(file_name) method (from the paratext_project_settings.py you provided) is reliable for extracting a book ID directly from a filename string, we could use that.

Let's try to integrate settings.get_book_id(file_name) into analyze_project_data for a faster pre-skip of individual files within a project that has already passed the initial folder-level qualification.

Explanation of the New Diff for analyze_project_data:

Conditional Pre-filtering Loop (Lines 338-358):
This loop is re-introduced but now uses settings.get_book_id(usfm_file_path_candidate.name).
It only runs if book_filter_list is active, usfm_files exist, settings were successfully parsed, AND the settings object has the get_book_id method.
Using settings.get_book_id():
It calls filename_book_id = settings.get_book_id(usfm_file_path_candidate.name).
If filename_book_id is successfully extracted:
It's converted to uppercase.
It's checked against is_canonical().
It's checked against the book_filter_list.
If the file can be confidently skipped based on these checks on the filename-extracted ID, a message is printed, and continue is used to skip adding it to files_to_process_fully.
If settings.get_book_id() returns None (can't determine ID from filename) or raises an exception, the file is added to files_to_process_fully for a full check via its \id tag.
The main loop then iterates over the potentially smaller files_to_process_fully list.
This approach attempts to get the best of both worlds:

Fast folder-level pre-qualification in get_project_paths using project_contains_filtered_books (which uses settings.get_book_file_name).
A reasonably fast file-level pre-skip within analyze_project_data using settings.get_book_id(), before falling back to full tokenization for files that pass this second check or couldn't be identified by filename.
The settings.get_book_id() method from your paratext_project_settings.py looks fairly comprehensive in how it tries to parse book IDs from filenames based on file_name_form, so this should be more effective than a generic regex.

Test this version. You should now see:

The "Scanning for project folders..." progress from get_project_paths.
Then, for each selected project, the "Pre-filtering N USFM files for project X using settings.get_book_id()." message.
Hopefully, many "Info: File '...' (book '...' from filename) not in book filter. Skipping." messages appearing quickly during this stage.
And then far fewer (or zero) "Info: Skipping book '...' found in ... (not in book_filter_list)." messages from the slower, post-tokenization check.

Can we make the skipping of individual files within a qualified project faster?

Yes, we could reintroduce a filename-based check for individual USFM files inside analyze_project_data, but this time using the settings.get_book_file_name() method if possible, or a simplified direct filename check. This would be great to do!

The challenge is that settings.get_book_file_name(book_id) requires you to know the book_id to generate the expected filename. We do know the book_id's that we are interested in. Once we are in a qualified project folder we shouldn't need to check all the files. We should be able to use settings.get_book_file_name(book_id) passing in the list of Book_ids contained in BOOK_FILTER Then process each of those files and skip any that are missing - hopefully they aren't missing since the folder was already checked that they were there.

Does that make sense?


Gemini
Yes, that makes perfect sense, and it's a very smart way to optimize the processing within analyze_project_data!

You're right. Once a project folder has been "qualified" by project_contains_filtered_books (meaning it's likely to contain at least one of the books from your BOOK_FILTER), we don't need to iterate through all USFM files in that project if a BOOK_FILTER is active. Instead, we can iterate through the BOOK_FILTER itself, generate the expected filename for each book in the filter using settings.get_book_file_name(), and then only attempt to process those specific files.

This approach has several benefits:

Targeted Processing: You only attempt to open and parse files that you are explicitly interested in (according to the BOOK_FILTER).
Speed: Drastically reduces the number of files to even consider opening within analyze_project_data if the BOOK_FILTER is restrictive.
Consistency: Relies on sil-machine's settings.get_book_file_name() for accuracy.
Here's how we can modify analyze_project_data to implement this:

Revised Logic for analyze_project_data:

Parse Settings.xml to get the settings object.
If book_filter_list is active:
Create an empty list files_to_process_from_filter.
For each book_id in book_filter_list:
Use settings.get_book_file_name(book_id) to get the expected filename.
Check if this file exists. If it does, add its Path object to files_to_process_from_filter.
If it doesn't exist (which ideally shouldn't happen often if project_contains_filtered_books worked correctly, but it's a good safeguard), print a warning.
The main processing loop will then iterate over files_to_process_from_filter.
If book_filter_list is not active:
The script will find all USFM files in the project directory as it does now (usfm_files.extend(Path(project_path).glob(pattern))).
The main processing loop will iterate over all these found USFM files.
This way, the "slow skip" (opening a file, tokenizing, then skipping based on \id) is largely eliminated when a BOOK_FILTER is active.

Let's implement this change.

Explanation of Changes in analyze_project_data:

Determine files_to_process (Lines 301-321):

An empty list files_to_process is initialized.
If book_filter_list is active AND settings were parsed AND settings has get_book_file_name:
A message is printed indicating targeted file processing.
It iterates through each book_id_from_filter in your book_filter_list.
It first checks if book_id_from_filter is canonical using is_canonical(). This is a safeguard to ensure settings.get_book_file_name() isn't called with something completely invalid that might cause it to error unexpectedly (though get_book_file_name itself should be robust).
settings.get_book_file_name(book_id_from_filter) is called to get the expected_filename_str.
The full expected_file_path is constructed.
If expected_file_path.exists(), it's added to files_to_process.
If it doesn't exist, a warning is printed. This situation should be less common if project_contains_filtered_books (which uses the same mechanism) correctly qualified the project folder, but it's a good check.
Includes a try-except around settings.get_book_file_name() in case it raises an unexpected error for a particular book ID.
Else (no book filter, or settings/method unavailable):
It falls back to the original behavior: find all USFM files in the project using Path(project_path).glob(pattern) and add them to files_to_process.
Early Exit: If files_to_process is empty after this stage, a warning is set, and the function returns early.
Main Loop Iterates over files_to_process (Line 323):

The loop for usfm_file_path in ...: now uses the files_to_process list, which is either the targeted list (if filtered) or the full list of USFM files.
Internal \id Tag Checks (Lines 343-353):

The checks for is_canonical(book_code_candidate) and book_code_candidate not in book_filter_list (if book_filter_list is active) remain.
Why keep them? Even if you target GEN.SFM because "GEN" is in your filter, it's theoretically possible (though bad practice) for that GEN.SFM file to internally start with \id PSA. These internal checks ensure you only process content truly belonging to the books you want, based on the authoritative \id tag.
The print messages are slightly updated for clarity.
If a book is skipped at this stage, it continues to the next token, effectively ignoring the content under that specific \id block within the file.
How this Improves Speed When Filtering:

When a BOOK_FILTER is active, analyze_project_data will no longer glob for all *.SFM/*.usfm files and then iterate through them one by one, opening and tokenizing each just to find its \id.
Instead, it directly constructs the expected filenames for only the books in your filter and checks for their existence. This means far fewer file system operations and no unnecessary opening/reading/tokenizing of files you don't care about within that project.
This should provide a significant speedup for the "Skipping book..." part when a BOOK_FILTER is active and the project has many USFM files not in your filter. The initial folder qualification by get_project_paths (using project_contains_filtered_books) handles whether the project is even considered, and this change optimizes what happens inside a qualified project.

Can we update the folder qualifying check to check that all of the books in BOOK_FILTER exist before the project is qualified? Am I correct in thinking that isn't the current logic?


Gemini
You're absolutely correct in your understanding! The current logic in project_contains_filtered_books qualifies a project folder if it finds at least one of the books specified in your book_filter_list.

Changing this to require that all books in the book_filter_list must exist for a project to qualify is a good refinement if your goal is to find projects that are complete with respect to a specific set of books.

Let's update the project_contains_filtered_books function to implement this "all must exist" logic.

The main change will be in how we determine the return value. Instead of returning True as soon as the first matching book file is found, we'll need to keep track of which books from the filter have been found and only return True if all of them are accounted for.

Key Changes in project_contains_filtered_books:

Docstring Update (Line 114): Clarified that it now checks for ALL books in the filter.
found_books_in_filter Set (Line 125): A new set, found_books_in_filter, is initialized to keep track of which books from your book_filter_list have been successfully found as existing files.
Loop Logic (Lines 127-133):
Instead of returning True immediately when a file is found, if (project_path / expected_filename).exists() is true, the book_id_filter is added to the found_books_in_filter set.
Final Check (Line 135):
After checking all books in book_filter_list, the function now returns found_books_in_filter == book_filter_list.
This comparison will only be True if every single book ID that was in your book_filter_list was also added to found_books_in_filter (meaning its corresponding file was found).
How this changes the behavior:

If your BOOK_FILTER is, for example, GEN,MAT,REV.
Old Logic: If a project folder contained GEN.SFM (or its equivalent based on settings) but not MAT.SFM or REV.SFM, project_contains_filtered_books would have returned True, and the project folder would have been considered a candidate by get_project_paths (if limit_n_projects_to_scan was active).
New Logic: The project folder will only be considered a candidate by get_project_paths if files corresponding to GEN, MAT, and REV (based on its Settings.xml) are all found to exist. If any one of them is missing, project_contains_filtered_books will return False for that project folder.
This makes the initial project qualification much stricter when a book_filter is applied, ensuring that analyze_project_data is only called for projects that have all the specific books you're targeting with the filter. This should align better with your goal of finding good test projects that have a complete set of the books you're interested in.

This project only contains OT books and the BOOK_FILTER contains a mix of NT and OT books, so the folder should have been filtered out.

The output shows that it wasn't filtered out. Any ideas about how to fix this?

You've pinpointed the issue perfectly! The output clearly shows that analyze_project_data was called for the "1948OT_build32_Uchen" project, which means get_project_paths did not filter it out. This, in turn, implies that project_contains_filtered_books (as it exists in your current project_analyser.py) must have returned True.

Looking at the project_contains_filtered_books function in the project_analyser.py file you provided in the context:

python
# f:\GitHub\davidbaines\project_analyser\project_analyser\project_analyser.py
# ...
def project_contains_filtered_books(project_path: Path, book_filter_list: set) -> bool:

    if not book_filter_list: # No filter means all books are included.
        return True

    settings_parser = FileParatextProjectSettingsParser(str(project_path))
    settings = settings_parser.parse()
    if not settings:
        # print(f"Debug: Could not parse Settings.xml for {project_path.name} during pre-scan. Assuming it doesn't qualify.")
        return False

    if not hasattr(settings, 'get_book_file_name'):
        # print(f"Debug: Parsed settings for {project_path.name} does not have 'get_book_file_name' method. Assuming it doesn't qualify.")
        return False 

    for book_id_filter in book_filter_list: # <--- Problematic loop
        book_num = book_id_to_number(book_id_filter)
        if book_num == 0: # Should not happen if book_filter_list uses valid IDs
            continue
        # Look for files like "01GEN*.sfm", "01GEN*.usfm", etc.
        # Pad book number to two digits
        search_pattern_prefix = f"{book_num:02d}{book_id_filter}"
        if any(f.name.upper().startswith(search_pattern_prefix) and f.suffix.lower() in ['.sfm', '.usfm'] 
               for f in project_path.iterdir() if f.is_file()):
            return True # <--- THIS IS THE ISSUE
    return False
# ...
The issue is exactly as you suspected: the line return True inside the loop causes the function to exit and return True as soon as it finds any file that matches its simplified search_pattern_prefix for any book in the book_filter_list. It does not check if all books from the filter are present. Furthermore, this loop isn't even using the settings.get_book_file_name() method we intended to use for accuracy.

We need to replace this loop with the logic that uses settings.get_book_file_name() for each book in the filter and only returns True if all of them are found.

Explanation of the Corrected Logic in project_contains_filtered_books:

Initialization: found_books_in_filter = set() is created to store the book IDs from your book_filter_list for which corresponding files are actually found in the project.
Iterate and Check:
The loop now iterates through book_id_filter in book_filter_list.
Inside the loop, it calls settings.get_book_file_name(book_id_filter) to get the exact expected filename based on the project's settings.
It then checks if this expected_filename exists within the project_path.
If the file exists, book_id_filter is added to the found_books_in_filter set.
A try-except block is included around settings.get_book_file_name() and the file existence check. If get_book_file_name fails for a particular book_id_filter (e.g., if the ID is truly invalid for that project's settings or causes an internal error in the method), that book simply won't be added to found_books_in_filter, and the loop will continue to the next book in your filter.
Final Return Condition: After checking all books in book_filter_list, the function returns found_books_in_filter == book_filter_list. This will only be True if every single book_id in your book_filter_list was found (i.e., its file existed and it was added to found_books_in_filter).
With this correction, project_contains_filtered_books will accurately determine if a project folder contains all the books specified in your BOOK_FILTER, using the project's own naming conventions via settings.get_book_file_name(). This should correctly filter out projects like "1948OT_build32_Uchen" if your BOOK_FILTER includes NT books.
